Twilight Sparkle sputtered at the sudden influx of voters. "Wha- where did all of you even come from!?"

"Hey! She's still yapping!" one of the masses shouted. "Take the hint!" cried another. "Aw, leave her alone," one more replied, and then the arguments started again.

Twilight was relieved that not *all* of them wanted her to shut up, nor even most of them, but still, the fact that it came down to a vote was pretty disenchanting. All the 'aye' voters wanted was for her to shut up and stop bothering them. Was that really so wrong? Maybe she was the one being unreasonable.

Silently she lowered her head, turned around, and walked back the way she came.

Watching her go, Hughbert Jellius shook his head. "I feel a little bad for her," he said.

"Ah, don't worry your schticky little head about it," Sea Breeze slurred. "She's just gonna go bother shomeone else now."

Hughbert said, "I guess so." Then he put a hoof into his mane. "Wait, am I really that sticky?"

Sea Breeze nodded, along with the most recognizable half of the voting crowd - the half that would know him best.

"Drat."
