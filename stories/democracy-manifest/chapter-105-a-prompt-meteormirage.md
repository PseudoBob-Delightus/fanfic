The Ponyville schoolyard was as busy and hectic as ever during recess. Little colts and fillies pushing each other on the swingset, sliding down the slide in tandem, or completely destroying each other on the buckball court. And yet, despite some facing eternal decimation, the mood was light, jovial, and full of childlike whimsy. 

For all except three. 

The mood around the Cutie Mark Crusaders was far more morose than usual, the three fillies trading languished sighs as they draped themselves over the bars of the playground carousel. And it seemed that their despair only continued to spiral with each slow turn of the carousel.

"It just ain't fair!" Apple Bloom groaned, stretching across her particular bar and stamping her hindhooves in anguish. "It's like they're treatin' us like a bunch of kids!"

"Well, to be fair, we-" Sweetie Belle began…

Only to be quickly interrupted by Scootaloo throwing her hooves up in anger. "Ugh, I know! It's not even like the concert is gonna keep us out that long!" She crossed her hooves with righteous fury, a harsh sigh breathed through her nostrils. "But no, it's all: *'You girls are too young!'* or *'It's way past your bedtime!'* and *'I'm not gonna chaperone you, kid, Coloratura isn't even real Punk.'* "

Apple Bloom raised an eyebrow. "Geeze, your aunts said all that?"

"W-well no, they're totally cool with me staying out late, but…" A light blush covered Scootaloo's face, quickly hidden as she turned it away from her two friends. "If your sisters won't let you go, then I'm not going either!"

Sweetie Belle thought for a moment, then raised a hoof to interject. "Hey, what if we-"

"Maybe we could try sneakin' out?" Apple Bloom suggested, putting a hoof to her chin in serious thought. "But if we get caught, I don't even wanna know what they'd do to us."

Scootaloo shrugged. "It's worth a shot, but-"

"*Girls, look!*" 

Sweetie Belle's sudden cry and subsequent hoof-pointing drew all of the attention to her, even the background foals either taking a look in her direction or ambling over to see what she was pointing at. Scootaloo and Apple Bloom briefly considered lambasting their friend for being so rude to interrupt while someone was speaking, but took the high road and simply looked towards her gesture.

A grouplet of ponies stood not too far away from the schoolhouse, forming a half-circle around one griffon who was speaking while gesturing with both claw and wing. As the griffon finished speaking, the ponies considered their words, and several amongst the group raised their hooves while the others abstained. The raisers and abstainers then quickly separated themselves into two groups standing perhaps a meter apart, and began to shout at each other while the despairing griffon made attempts to calm them down.

The foals of the Ponyville schoolyard all looked on in a mixture of confusion and disappointment, heads tilting as they wondered exactly why they'd been pulled from their revelry to witness adults being as confusing as adults usually were. 

Scootaloo turned to Sweetie Belle, her face awash with disappointment in her dearest friend. "What are we looking at, exactly?"

"It's that- that thing the adults are doing now that miss Mayor is gone!" Sweetie Belle cried again. "The phlebotomy thing!"

"They're takin' each other's blood?" Apple Bloom asked. 

"No, dummy, they're *voting* on stuff." Sweetie Belle rolled her eyes, huffing at her friend's clear misinterpretation of adult matters. "Rarity told me all about it. It's when all the adults are arguing about something, so they count their opinions to see who wins. Thing is, once the voting is done no one can do anything to change it. Even if they weren't even asked about it!"

Apple Bloom nodded slowly, then tilted her head. "And… what does that gotta do with what we're doin'?"

Sweetie Belle sighed, the mysteries of the Adults clearly ungraspable by her earth pony friend. However, the last of the trio already had wheels beginning to spin.

A mischievous glint sparked in Scootaloo's eye as she quickly took to the top of the carousel, balancing on the colorful metal bars with ease as she now overlooked the foals that surrounded.

"Foals of Ponyville!" She screeched, extending out a hoof in a grand, sweeping gesture to encapsule all of her audience. "For too long we've been treated like our opinions just don't matter! Like we can't make choices for ourselves, and have to be told what to eat, or where to go, or even when to go to bed!" She drew her hoof to her heart, holding it there with passion as she shook her head. "But I say that *sucks*!"

Reactions from the audience were mixed, some nodding and murmuring in agreement while others gasped at the filly's use of harsh language. While she was clearly emboldened, there was no reason to go to such extremes on their pleasant playground. 

But Scootaloo wasn't halted by the gasps, feeling the rising support lighting a fire in her heart as she continued. "I say we take control into our own hooves, and tell those dumb adults they can't tell us what to do anymore! I say we use this voting thing to make sure no adult can tell us what to do ever again! If you're with me, uh…" Blinking in confusion, Scootaloo looked down towards Sweetie Belle. "How do we do this… uh, thing?"

Sweetie Belle simply shrugged. "I guess you just… put your hoof up if you agree?" 

Turning back to the crowd, her head now high as she was emboldened with Knowledge, she raised a hoof towards the sky. "If you're with me, put a hoof up and vote!"
