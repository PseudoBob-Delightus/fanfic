Pinkie just shrugs as the vote fails. "Eh, guess you can't win 'em all."

The mare says, "Sorry."

the group leaves as Pinkie returns to Fluttershy. She is back where they had held the previous vote.

Pinkie pulls Fluttershy into a hug. "Hey, Fluttershy."

Fluttershy hugs back. "Hi, Pinkie."

Pinkie nuzzles Fluttershy.

Fluttershy whispers, "I love you…"

Pinkie whispers back, "I love you, too."

After the hug, Fluttershy looks at the ground, eyes focusing on Pinkie's hoof.

Pinkie notices and offers it to her.

Fluttershy takes it and holds it. "Pinkie… I really like you."

Pinkie blushes. "I really like you too."

Fluttershy blushes and hides halfway in her mane. "Pinkie, I mean… Will you go out with me?"

Pinkie excitedly says, "Yes!"

Fluttershy smiles as Pinkie hugs her again. "Yay!"

"Yay indeed!"

Fluttershy giggles. "I wanted to ask you out when I said you were cute earlier, but I needed some more time to build up the confidence."

"I'm glad you were able to, you did great!"

The hug ends and Fluttershy says, "I still think you are cuter."

"I'm biased, but you are cuter."

Fluttershy blushes and hugs Pinkie to hide it. "I love you."

Pinkie hugs back. "I love you too!"
