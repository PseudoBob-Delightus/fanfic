## Chapter ~~1~~ 24hr
- Twilight discovers the story is going to explode in 24 hours
- Twilight wakes up and feels things are *off*. She brushes her hair and the story narrates this as "I brushed my hair for the last time". Then she thinks, "why did I think that?"
- She walks outside and thinks, "That's the last time I'll see the sunrise". Now she's questioning her own thoughts out loud and worrying townsfolk.
- Twilight asks Spike what the hay is going on and he says "maybe it has something to do with that?" (points upwards at a screenshot of the story title)
- "This Story Will Explode In 24 Hours"
- "Well, horseapples." 

## Chapter 23
- Nobody believes Twilight. Maybe something about the title screenshot being sideways relative to them so they can't see it.
- She has to find ponies who will understand. Ponies who are used to nonsense like this happening.
- Oh right! Pinkie Pie!

## Chapter 22
- Pinkie Pie
- Maybe Pinkie Pie warns her against overreacting to a predicted disaster, lest she prove it correct.
- This calm and rational response just freaks her out even more!
