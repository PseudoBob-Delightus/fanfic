It was an odd sight - a Royal Guard, strutting around Ponyville like he belonged there.

Evidently he was here for a purpose - he wore a saddlebag stuffed with papers, and, upon reaching a wooden light post in the market square, he took one out and stapled it to the post, then continued on, doing the same to fences, doorways, and notice boards all the way down the street.

When the coast was clear, a motley group of ponies emerged from cover and approached the light post.

"It's a decree," Sea Swirl observed. "A *royal* decree."

Fine Fettle asked, "From Twilight?"

Hughbert Jellius tore the notice from the post and read it closely. "It says it's a message from the 'diarchy'."

"Celestia and Luna, then."

The other two crowded behind Hughbert as he continued reading.

> TO ALL INHABITANTS OF PONYVILLE,
> 
> ON BEHALF OF THE DIARCHY,
> 
> THIS TOWNESHIP HAS BECOME A HOUSE OF MAVERICKS. 
> 
> COME OUT OF DOORS BEFORE SUNSET THIS EVE 
> 
> AND PLEDGE FEALTY TO THE CROWN ONCE MORE;
> 
> OR LET ALL BE NAMED TRAITORS AND SUFFER THEREWITH.
> 
> GLORY TO EQUESTRIA.

"That doesn't sound good," Sea Swirl said dryly.

"Oh, *really*?" Hughbert griped. "Not good, huh? Being named a traitor? *Not good*!?"

"Guys..."

"I'm really glad you think this doesn't sound good!"

Fine Fettle came between them. "Come on, this is no time to argue. The sun sets in a few hours."

Hughbert Jellius glanced at the skyline, and sighed. "Hah... You're right. I'm sorry."

"It's fine." Sea Swirl patted his shoulder.

"It's just... I thought maybe we were doing things right, you know?" Hughbert continued. "Making decisions for ourselves, for once. I might not have agreed with all of them..."

"I certainly didn't," Sea Swirl said. Fine Fettle nodded.

"... but it felt like the power was in our very hooves. Like we'd been sleeping all these years, and just now woken up, ready to take control of our own destinies."

Fine Fettle asked, "Is that why you voted to rename Ponyville to 'Towny McTownface'?"

Hughbert cracked a smile. "Hay, nopony ever said this destiny business had to be completely serious."

They all had a good laugh, and their eyes drifted naturally to the hills outside of town. Every pony in town was looking there. There was smoke and fire, tent canvas and flash of metal - a camp had begun to assemble, boasting the Sun and Moon banner. The banner of war.

"Does it really have to be over so soon?" one of them asked. It didn't matter which one - they were all thinking it.

What came next, they all thought of, too.
