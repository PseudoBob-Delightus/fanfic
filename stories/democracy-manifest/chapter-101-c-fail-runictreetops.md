Votes were cast. Ponies nodded, others argued. However, the results were clear: The crowd was in favor of Twilight's wings.

"Oh, thank Celestia," Twilight sighed. "I *just* paid for these!"

With an innocent smile on her face, Twilight, lunch lover that she was, sat back down at her table. Her magical mumbo-jumbo kicked in and she eagerly levitated the first of what was sure to be many delicious wings to her mouth. A fine lunch, if not a large one.

"That's not fair," one stallion pouted.

"Go buy your own, broke boy," another mare chuckled.

"I've still got some wings I can share if you want."

"Nobody asked you, Cloud Chaser!"

Thus, lunch in Ponyville passed by, and no further issues arose. At least, not until the next issue arose.

Those ponies. Always with the lunch.
