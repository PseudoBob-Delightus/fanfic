Welcome to Democracy, fellow constituents!

In these dark times, it is imperative that we make our voices heard. This pamphlet will instruct you on the proper course of doing just so - and casting a vote.

If somepony makes a proposal you **like**, you should consider voting for it. To vote in favour of a proposal you must raise your hoof, or say "aye", or otherwise make some gesture that unambiguously indicates that you **like** the proposal. It is important that you communicate that you **like** the proposal - if enough ponies **like** it, it might pass!

If somepony makes a proposal you **don't like**, don't do anything rude. That won't help anypony. It's true that there's no such thing as a negative vote. But the absence of a vote is just as good! If you **don't like** a proposal, simply withhold your vote, and convince others not to vote, if you can. That's what you should do if you **don't like** it. Hint hint.
