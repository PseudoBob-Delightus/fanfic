"...any minute now." Scootaloo said as she stared down at her peers who shifted from hoof to hoof with indecision. 

A few hooves slowly raised, namely those of her two friends and a few of the poor nameless background foals. 

Pipsqueak, the smallest colt and perennial Heart of their class, scratched his foreleg with a hoof while looking to the ground with mild discomfort. "I dunno if mum'd be alright with it, is all." The colt squeaked, never daring to look Scootaloo in the eyes as he did so. 

Standing ever-present by Pipsqueak's side, Rumble nodded in agreement. "Yeah, I think my bro would be pretty torn up about it. He does a lot for me, y'know?"

After a long few seconds of consideration, Snails lifted his head and tilted it in confusion. "Don't they all, like… do a lot for us anyway? I dunno, maybe adults are pretty great after all."

A few more foals chipped in their own apprehension with voting so strongly against the adults they knew and loved, and with each word the flame in Scootaloo was stoked ever higher.

"Don't you all see? This is exactly what they want!" Scootaloo shouted over all the discenters. "Doesn't this just prove that their hold on us is-"

The school bell chimed, drowning out any further arguments Scootaloo could make and drawing all attention back to the schoolhouse. There, Cheerilee poked her head out with a bright grin and waved a hoof at her students.

"Alright children, wrap it up!" Cheerilee said sweetly, a gentle smile across her lips. "Recess is over, and now it's time to learn about the wonderful world of *long division*!" 

Without another word, the foals of Cheerilee's class slowly trudged their way back towards the schoolhouse, none of whom were eager to learn about math but also unable to prevent the unending march of education. This left just three little fillies, once again alone and draped over the bars of the carousel.

"Well, that didn't work." Sweetie Belle groaned.

Apple Bloom sighed and shook her head. "I thought it was gonna too. but I guess nothin's gonna stop adults now."

Scootaloo, too annoyed and angry to form Equish words, simply groaned loudly and slammed her forehead into the carousel. This did nothing to fix the anger, but at least she felt better in doing something.

"Maybe we could still try sneaking out?" Sweetie Belle suggested, lightning her magic to form a soft barrier between Scootaloo's forehead and the carousel. "Even if our classmates are falling in line, *we* could still challenge authority."

"Or we could just have a sleepover at my place." Apple Bloom said. "It'd probably be easier to get our sisters to agree to that."

Slowly, Scootaloo raised her head from the cushion of Sweetie Belle's magic and looked at her two friends.

"Wanna vote on it?"
