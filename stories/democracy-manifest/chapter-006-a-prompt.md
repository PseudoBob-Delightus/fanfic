"Alright, ponies!" came the megaphone call, reporting Pinkie Pie's voice far and wide. "What do we want?"

"Ponyville three inches to the left!" came the cacophonous reply of hundreds of ponies.

The megaphone caught the tail of a snorting laugh before Pinkie got more serious. "Huh? I didn't hear you. Maybe I need to try this again... *What do we want!?*"

It was markedly louder: "Ponyville three inches to the left!"

"Are we in a library or something? Speak up! WHAT DO WE WANT!!!" Glass shook in windows from the noise.

"PONYVILLE THREE INCHES TO THE LEFT!!!"

"AND WHEN DO WE WANT IT?"

"NOW!!!"

Beneath the din of amplified laughter, the rumble of hooves began - and did not stop.
