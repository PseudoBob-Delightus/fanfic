"Aye?" Rainy hazarded.

"Aye?" Ditzy echoed, as if considering the feel of the word.

"Aye!" Appointed cheered. "Motion carries!"

"Democracy sounds a lot like piracy," said Rainy.

Appointed flapped over and draped a foreleg over her withers. "Well, matey, you're on shore leave now. Arr."

"Well, it *is* a nice day," said Ditzy. "Maybe Dinky's class voted to end early and we can have a picnic."

Sunny Delivery poked her head into the sorting room just in time to see most of the other postal workers leaving. "Where are you all going?" she cried, the basket balanced on her head nearly spilling its envelopes. "Half the mail is unsorted and I just got thirty party invitations with same-day delivery!"

"Sorry, Sunny," said Rainy. "We voted to take a break."

"Voted?"

"That's right!" Appointed puffed out her chest, beaming with pride. "Mayor Mare put power in the hooves of the ponies!"

Sunny rolled her eyes. "Great. Can one of you put those powerful hooves in front of the service desk for a few minutes, at least?"

That got a thoughtful frown. "I'm pretty sure that's a late amendment. Or maybe election interference."

"Not it!"

"Not it!"

"Wait, what?" Appointed turned to see the others already out the door, in midair, and rapidly climbing.

Sunny patted her on the withers as she walked by, loading up another set of saddlebags with the invitations. "Go help the customers while you figure out what to call this. Pinkie Pie certainly won't wait for a vote to chew us out if her party's underpopulated."

"Aww." Wings drooping, Appointed trudged towards the waiting line. "No wonder ponies don't go into politicsâ€¦"
