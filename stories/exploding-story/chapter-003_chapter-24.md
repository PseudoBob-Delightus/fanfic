# Pinkie Pie

Twilight knocks on Pinkie's bedroom door. The door opens.

Twilight enters. "Pinkie, are you here?"

A rustle comes from one of Pinkie's cabinets, before moments later Pinkie springs out of it doing cartwheels.

Pinkie stops just before hitting Twilight, her mane springing forward, booping Twilight.

"Hi, Twilight, what's up?"

"I was wonder if you knew anything about that?" Twilight points up at the title.

"Oh, no, I don't know anything, but I wonder what happens when a story explodes!"

"You really didn't have anything to do with this?"

"No, do you think I could touch it if I jump high enough?"

"Pinkie, this is serious. We need to figure out what's going on."

Pinkie wasn't listening, she was already jumping to try and touch the title.

"Pinkie!"

After another moment of hopelessly trying to touch it, Pinkie gives up. "Yes, Twilight?"

"We need to go and figure this out."

"Okay, let me grab my *exploding story confetti* and I'll be ready!" Pinkie says before rummaging in her closet.

"Why do you have confetti for exploding stories?"

Pinkie lifts out a confetti container, marked on the side in bubbly font: Exploding Story Confetti. "Never ask why dear Twilight, but why not."

"Okay, so, you're ready?"

"Are you sure this isn't another one of those self-fulfilling prophecies? You're really good at those!"

"Yes, I'm sure. How can you be so calm about this? Aren't you worried at all?"

"An exploding story sounds fun! I can't wait to see what happens."

"Okay, let's go, Pinkie."

Pinkie nods then Twilight started out the door. Pinkie follows behind, bouncing bubbly with a smile.
