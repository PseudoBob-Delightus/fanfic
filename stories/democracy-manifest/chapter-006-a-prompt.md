"Alright, ponies!" came the megaphone call, reporting Pinkie Pie's voice far and wide. "What do we want?"

"Ponyville 3 inches to the left!" came the cacophonous reply of hundreds of ponies.

The megaphone caught the tail of a snorting laugh before Pinkie got more serious. "Huh? I didn't hear you. Maybe I need to try this again... *What do we want!?*"

It was markedly louder: "Ponyville 3 inches to the left!"

"Are we in a library or something? Speak up! WHAT DO WE WANT!!!"

"PONYVILLE 3 INCHES TO THE LEFT!!!"

"AND WHEN DO WE WANT IT?"

"NOW!!!"

Beneath the din of amplified laughter, the rumble of hooves began - and did not stop.
