A few ponies stuck their hooves up and said 'aye', but the rest were uncertain, which made the few ponies with their hooves up also feel uncertain.

The old stallion frowned. "Well, some o' you got it..." He looked across the group, critical of the ones who seemed indecisive. "I think if'n you practice a mite, you'll have it all figured out in no time. So why don't you all run off now and try decidin' things for folk, eh?"

The crowd dispersed with a shrug, and a few groups went here or there with murmured discussions about how they might try this system. But a few ponies stayed back, still curious.

"Just a minute," one said. "Is it just called 'the system'? Or do they call it something different in Pegalopolis?"

"Hmmm," the stallion thought. "It might have a few different names, like, dependin' on where you get it from. But from what my daughter tells me, in Pegalopolis...

"They call it democracy."
