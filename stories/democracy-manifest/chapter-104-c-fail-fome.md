The sorting room was silent, save for sounds filtering in from outside and the service counter. Sunny Delivery poked her head into the room, a basket of envelopes balanced on her head. "What's everypony doing?"

"Democracy!" Appointed said with a smile.

Sunny seemed less than impressed. "Well I have thirty party invitations with same-day delivery here, and none of them are addressed to a Democracy." She upended the basket into Appointed's saddlebags. "Get back out on your rounds, Rounds, or Pinkie Pie will have our coverts for pillow stuffing."

Appointed drooped and spread her wings. "Aww. Motion failed, I guess."

"More fiber'll fix that," said Ditzy, returning to her sorting.

Rainy stuck out her tongue at her. "You just like bran."

Ditzy grinned and raised her hoof. "Aye!"

"Oh sure, *now* you get the ideaâ€¦" Appointed grumbled on her way out the door.
