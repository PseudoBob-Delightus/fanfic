"So who are you looking for now?"

"Rainbow Dash," Twilight said. They'd started on the trail back to Ponyville. "I figure she's-"

Applejack stopped in her tracks. "Nah, I know how to find her."

"You've seen her?"

"Nah." Applejack simply sat where she stood, took a deep breath, and let out a thunderous call: "GA-A-AY!"

After a few seconds, a streak of rainbow could be seen over the horizon, zeroing in on their position *fast*. At its terminus a pegasus materialized, flaring her wings and scraping her hooves through dirt to slow down. When she finally came to a stop, she asked, "Who called?"

"Wow, that's impressive," Twilight commented.

"I know, right?" Applejack and Rainbow Dash said simultaneously, though perhaps for different reasons.

Twilight drew Rainbow Dash's eyes away from Applejack. "Rainbow, you can fly. Do you know anything about this?"

"Uh... About what? Being gay?"

"No, that."

"What? How did I not notice that before?"

Twilight rolled her eyes. "Okay, you don't know anything. Great. Guess we'll-"

"Hold on." Rainbow Dash pretended to roll up her sleeves even though Twilight was pretty sure she'd never worn a shirt in her life. "If we stop the timer, it can't explode, right?"

Twilight had to think about that question for a second or two. That proved to be a second or two too long, as Rainbow Dash had already jumped into the air and made some distance. With another rainbow streak, she plowed into the floating title.

"Ow."
