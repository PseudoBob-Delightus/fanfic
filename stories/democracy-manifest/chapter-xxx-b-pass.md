Sunset came and went, and the Royal Guard descended into town.

They found the homes and streets of 'Ponyville' oddly deserted, when just hours before it had been bustling with civilian life - distorted though it was with this poison of democracy.

The truth was swiftly revealed when a peasant army burst from the shadows, enveloping the patrolling guards and subduing them with domestic weaponry (such as brooms, shovels, anvils, large panes of glass held across the street, etc). The guards in the rear attempted to retreat, but there was nowhere to retreat to, for their camp had also been overrun - the Sun and Moon banner, taken.

In its place a makeshift flag, field emblazoned with three crossed hooves, was raised over the hill, and the ring of a great pink cannon's mouth shone in the fresh moonlight. A masked, cloaked pony held a torch over its breech. 

This pony called out, "For Towny McTownface!"

The same words rang out, piecemeal, on the streets shortly after. "For Towny McTownface!"

Then, all at once, just as red flame licked black powder, they shouted: 

"FOR DEMOCRACY!"
