"Oh, come on, stay!" Fine Fettle called out to the departing crowd. "We can figure this out, I'm sure of it!"

Shadow mumbled, "Fine..."

"Not you, too, Hughbert!"

Hughbert Jellius couldn't do much but shrug. "Sorry. I wish I could have helped, but, the votes..."

"That's just Sea Swirl's thing! Don't tell me you'll let a little democracy stop you?"

Hughbert shook his head, made a sheepish smile, and backed away. "I just don't want to get involved in something if it won't work. I'm really sorry, Fine. Shadow."

Fine Fettle watched their last hope disappear into the distance.

"... Bye," it said.

Shadow sighed, looking at the one stallion who'd stayed with him, rope in hooves. Fine Fettle looked more devastated than he felt. "It's okay," he said.

"No."

"What?"

"No, it's *not* okay," Fine Fettle growled. "I'm not going to leave you stuck in that well. That's *not* going to happen."

"Um..."

A mysterious wind grew around them, and Fine Fettle's loose mane began to stand on end. "And I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it costs me. I *will* find a way. Even if it-"

"Kills you?"

"Exactly."

Shadow rolled his eyes. "You're doing the thing again."

The strange air currents suddenly stopped. "Oh, am I?"

"Yeah. This is totally the thing that happens when a hero is about to cast their morals aside in order to achieve victory at any cost."

"Oh."

"Uhuh."

"Does it ever end well for the hero?"

Shadow thought about it for a moment. "Nope."

"Drat."

They both sat there for a minute or so.

"Okay," Fine Fettle sighed. "How about this. I will keep trying to get you out of the well. But I won't stop at nothing, or whatever."

Shadow raised an eyebrow. "So you'll stop at something?"

"No, I- I just mean I'll try a regular amount. Okay?"

"Okay. That's better."

"Good."

"I really appreciate it."

"Thank you."

"*ahem* Get on with it *ahem*"

"What?"

"Nothing."

Fine Fettle narrowed his eyes. "I'll bring you a cough drop."
