The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and the flowers were blooming; it was a beautiful day in Ponyville. Of course, these things happened in many places that were not Ponyville, and in much more beautiful a fashion, too, but Mayor Mare would take what she could get in this backwater.

Her letters had arrived on time, and her laundry had come off the line not a bit damp, and this day had remained *so* beautiful for *so* long, in fact, that Mayor Mare made her way to the markets without even pay one bit of mind to a crowd of ponies standing around a well scratching their heads and waiting for somepony who looked like they might be in charge. "Hey Miss!" one of the hay-seeds called her over. "Can I ask ya somethin'?"

The correct answer to this question was 'yes', because he was entirely capable of asking her something, as the question itself proved.

And the polite answer to this question was also 'yes', because it was polite to answer questions of passers-by, no matter how suspicious or strange they looked, sounded, or smelled.

But the true answer to this question was not an answer at all, because this was not truly a question; it was a proclamation that a question's arrival was imminent and inviolable. A question *would* follow such a phrase no matter the response. The only option if one did not wish to hear the following question was to get out of earshot as fast as possible, but here and now, in this alley, the only means of transportation that would carry a pony away fast enough was a catapult, and alas - she had left hers in her other pair of pants.

So she answered, after an almost barely perceptible delay, "Of course; how can I help?"

The pony gestured towards the well, where the crowd, now aware of the presence of an authority, separated. Mayor Mare saw in that well a large creature with a smooth black coat and long wide horns jutting out from his head. The well's winch rope was wrapped around one of his horns, and all four of the bull's legs were wedged firmly within the well. He looked back at her with a sheepish smile.

"How did-"

"Sorry," he said.

"No, I just..." Mayor Mare rubbed her eyes, then her forehead. She had to maintain her 'goodly mayor' voice. "I simply do not understand how that happened."

The bull gestured around with what little mobility he had, and gave some meandering explanation of the sequence of events which began with him getting a little thirsty earlier this morning and ended with him having to explain this exact thing to this exact pony, which happened, this time, to be Mayor Mare.

"I see," she said, though when she really thought about it - and she did for a long time afterwards - she didn't really see how that sequence of events *could* have happened. 

The bull seemed to see this on her face, and argued, "Listen, I never said the decisions that led to this were good ones." And she had to agree with him there - he never did say that. "But could we focus on getting me out of here? My hooves are getting kinda tingly, and I don't think that's very good..."

"Good point." Mayor Mare looked around at the crowd of ponies, many of them being burly earth ponies who could no doubt lift a full-grown bull out of a small hole. She asked, "What have you tried so far?"

The stallion who called her over answered, "Oh, well, we've mostly just been trying to find somepony who knows how to get a bull out of a well."

"I don't think such a specific pony exists."

"Ah."

"Just throwing ideas out there - have you tried using a rope?"

"You mean like that one there?" The stallion pointed to the winch rope wrapped around the bull's horn.

"Yes, exactly, except one that's not currently attached to the bull or the well."

"Hm, we can probably find one like that, yeah."

"Well I think that'd be a *great* start." Mayor Mare patted the stallion on the shoulder, and glanced over at the bull, and the crowd, and wished them luck with their future endeavours and whatnot. She was met with a round of thanks, peppered with a few wonderings about what "endeavours" were, but she had already made enough distance between herself and the crowd that social convention no longer trapped her.

She was free! Relief, elation, triumph - these were felt for a bare moment. Then she spotted a white unicorn with a flamboyant hairdo, who was examining two nearly identical hats as they floated in the air astride her.

Spotting Rarity was not the worst thing in the world. The trouble came when Rarity spotted her. She made it look nonchalant, but it was clear who'd landed in her sights.

*Just keep heading to the markets*, Mayor Mare deluded herself. *She'll give up once she realizes I'm not stopping.*

But it was not to be. Rarity's special talent was not finding gems, but 'running into' ponies with whom she wished to speak. Even Mayor Mare's subtle zig-zag to throw off the trail, so effective on the average petitioner or consultant, was nothing to this unicorn's skill at dead reckoning. She simply closed her eyes and pranced along a line of perfect interception. No direction in physical space would suffice, for time flowed only in one direction, and there was Rarity, the wall between past and future.

"Oh my, what a coincidence!" she exclaimed upon opening her eyes and noticing Mayor Mare was standing there. "Mayor Mare! Why, I just so happened to have a question for you."

*At least she's not pretending there's another option*, Mayor Mare thought. But if it would get her out of her hair all the sooner, there was no reason not to say, "Of course; how can I help?"

Rarity displayed the two hats she'd been levitating. "I was just looking for a second opinion. Which of these do you think would look best in the market square today?"

Wondering about the specificity of the question, Mayor Mare looked at one hat, then at the other. They were both yellow-ish, matching Rarity's yellow sunglasses and yellow saddlebags and yellow hoof polish and so forth. Beyond that they were both extravagant and floral and large. But she couldn't see much of a difference between them. She strongly suspected Rarity had already made her decision, but wanted some input for some other inconcievably vain reason.

"I think you would be a better judge of that than me, Rarity," she said, knowing it wouldn't really have the desired effect. At the same time she scanned the horizon, the corners of homes and businesses, for some way out.

"Ah, but you underestimate yourself, *darling*," came the reply, punctuated by *that* word, her equivalent of a hobnail to the gut. "I trust your judgement when it comes to style and accessorizing. I really do."

Rarity's razor tone was making it difficult for Mayor Mare to keep up her goodly-mayor voice. "Well, I'm flattered. I suppose if I were to wear one of these, I'd wear that one," she pointed to one of them at random. "I'm heading to the markets right now, so I'd love to see how it looks there!"

"I see..." Rarity examined the hat she'd pointed to with a raised eyebrow. "What made you choose this one... *darling*?"

Mayor Mare felt a sweat coming on, even though the breeze was cool. Her ability to disengage from this encounter depended entirely on her next response. She couldn't be so diplomatic this time. She needed to think of something that would really knock Rarity's socks off - so to speak - without just causing more problems.

She'd been saving something like that for a time, so it pained her to use it at this moment, but it seemed the situation called for it.

"Honestly, Rarity..."

The unicorn leaned in subtly, curious where this was going. *Stick the landing...*

"I think this one, in particular, *really* contemplates your eyes."

She knew already that she'd made a mistake. It was 'compliments', not 'contemplates'! *Stupid!* *Blew it on the first try!*

But the euphoric look on Rarity's face told a different story. "Really...?" she mumbled dreamily, no longer looking at anything in particular. "Compliments my eyes?"

"Ab-so-lutely," Mayor Mare proclaimed, as she began to walk away. Some obscene sound of self-appreciation erupted from Rarity's lungs, but Mayor Mare turned the nearest corner she could find, and the sound fell away with distance.

Peace. And Quiet. Two things Mayor Mare had much trouble finding today.

She knew it was the fault of her own stupid mouth, though. She felt obligated to entertain the questions of her constituents, even though they were asinine if not insane. If she was to buy what she needed at the market without more interruptions, delays, and headache-inducing conversations, she was to pay no mind to any more random petitions.

"Hey Mayor, got a minute?"

This was easier said than done.

"What colour you think I should paint this fence?" asked the earth pony, sitting next to a bucket of white paint and a freshly unpainted fence. Mayor Mare's eye twitched as she kept walking. "Hello-o-o?" He knocked on his head, which made a hollow sound. "Anyone in there? Aw shucks... I done gonna have to figure this out myself, I reckon..." - or at least that's what Mayor Mare imagined he continued to say after she was out of earshot.

Things were even worse in the market. She didn't really think she was going to get in and get out without catching a few strays, but...

"You think my wagon is crooked, Miss?"

"How hard should I whoop these thievin' fillies' arses?"

"Are you going to do something about these carrot prices?"

"What do you think I should do about that crooked wagon?"

"Hey Mayorifico, can you bring back the chocolate milk rain?"

"Darling, I've finally found you - what was it you were saying about my eyes?"

"You think it's even a bad thing if the wagon's a little crooked?"

Mayor Mare couldn't take one more step without another bombardment of stupid questions from stupid ponies in this stupid market. *Why'd I even leave my office?*, she thought. *There's plenty of questions back there!*

The final straw came when a stallion with a gray coat and strawberries on his flank raised his hoof and took a breath. His name was Humphrey Jellibert or something. He hadn't even asked her a question - it just *looked* like he was about to ask a question. Just one more question. That was more than enough.

The goodly-mayor voice ran out. In its place a low rumble started in the throat and slowly tore its way through the mouth and nose, labouring in its ululation. It was not a coherent word, but was not a scream, per se, either. Its report was more akin to the rattle ponies made when they finished breathing.

The questions stopped. At last.

By the time Mayor Mare was again capable of conscious thought she was at the train station with a packed bag, surrounded by a worried, but unconfused, crowd. A steam whistle roared, and passengers clamoured onto their seats. She was last aboard - but not so callous that she would not say a proper goodbye.

"I'm going on vacation," she explained. "I don't know for how long. You'll have to figure things out on your own." 

Mayor Mare found her seat. The brakes released and the train started moving. Ponyville - and the townsfolk at the tracks - began moving backward an inch at a time. An impulse struck and she opened the window, stuck her head out, and shouted back at them, "Ponyville better still be here when I get back!" 

She wasn't sure they heard her. But she figured, as she closed the window and returned to her seat, there was no way they could screw things up *that* badly.

...

... *Right?*

---

The gathered ponies watched as the train disappeared into the distance - and they felt a disappearing, too, of their hopes for the future.

"What are we going to do now?" one pony asked.

"What if she never comes back?" one pony wondered.

"I never even asked her my question," Hughbert Jellius lamented. "And now I'll never know the anwer!"

There suddenly came a single laugh from a bench near the platform. "Hah!" The crowd looked and saw a stallion sitting there, wrinkled and shrunken in his old age. "So, you youngsters don't know what to do without yer mayor, eh?"

"Yes!" they all cried.

"Eh?" he asked. "Oh, yes, you said. Right. Well, I s'pose I ain't s'posed to know this sort o' thing either, on account o' my generation, but I got a grand-daughter in one o' them cities down there-" he gestured in a vague direction. "Pegalopolis it was. And she tells me they don't got a leader what's put on top o' them from above, like mayors' like."

"They don't have anypony in charge?"

"Eh? What, course they got some pony or another in charge. They just ain't placed on top of them such like." The old pony cleared his throat and quieted down, affecting a conspiratorial tone. "They in Pegalopolis pick 'em *themselves*."

A gasp rang out in the crowd. "Pick 'em themselves!?" one pony exclaimed. "How is that possible?"

The old stallion smiled. "It's a whole system. I'll shows ya how it works, right? First you need somethin' to decide. Doesn't matter what, but let's say we want to decide if'n we're going to decide somethin' in such a ways. You follow me?"

The ponies looked back at him blankly.

"... 'Kay. I *propose* we take up this system and use it while the Mayor's gone. If any o' you agree, you can raise your hoof, like-" he raised his right forehoof up in the air. "Or say 'aye', like. Or some such thing that everyone understands means you like the idea, you see?"

There were murmurs and vague nods amongst the crowd.

"One last time, folks. If'n you think we should use this system, raise yer hoof and say 'aye'."
