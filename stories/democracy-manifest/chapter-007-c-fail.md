"Okay, he can stay already," Doctor Horse finally relented. "But I am not treating him. Would be a conflict of interest, you see?"

Redheart rolled her eyes. "Whatever."

Taking a deep breath, and bracing herself to effect her bedside-voice, she stepped into the room with the human. The first thing she noticed was that cyclic noise he made. He would lean back to suck air in through his teeth, which made a sound like 'sssh', and then lean forward to let out a groan that sounded like 'aaah', then he would do it again. Again and again. Even with her standing right next to him. She wondered if he was doing it for attention.

"Thank you for your patience, sir," she began. "Have you had a chance to fill out your entrance form?"

He broke out of the cycle as if he'd never been doing it in the first place. "Ah, yeah, that's over here. Hope you can read my handwriting."

She examined the sheet and found that exactly none of it was legible. He wrote this with his 'hands'? No wonder. "No trouble at all," she assured him. "I'll bring a doctor in to examine you shortly. We're happy to accommodate you, but I must say, we don't get humans in here very often."

"Really?" the human asked. "It's been about three or four months since last time, right?"

"Last time...?"

"Yeah, that sleigh riding accident. I think one of you treated me for, um, smoke inhalation and a concussion?"

Redheart's eyes widened. "That was *you*?"

"I mean, I was concussed," he admitted. "So I don't remember how it happened. But I was definitely here for that, yeah."

"And before that, there was that stone... petrification... thing-"

"Cockatrice. Nasty critters."

"*That was you, too*!?"

"Yep."

"Oh my Celestia..."

"The first was around this time last year, when I fell through a manhole into a manticore den, and if that wasn't bad enough, the whole story damn near-"

"So there *are* no other humans," Redheart interjected. "It's been you every time."

Though there were no features on his face with which to make such an expression, it certainly seemed like the human was smiling at her. "Imagine my luck, huh?"

Redheart was struck with a sudden and deep feeling of regret, and a profound question entered into her mind: *Can I change my vote?*
