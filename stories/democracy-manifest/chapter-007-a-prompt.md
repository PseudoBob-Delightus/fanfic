"By all respects, he appears like your average dude."

"Ah. Let me guess." Doctor Horse neglected to look up from his broadsheet. "Human, unemployed, obsessed with foals' media, and skin in some nauseating, unnatural shade. Am I near the mark?"

Nurse Redheart nodded. "You're right on it, Doctor."

"I should hope so. We treated a patient of this description around this time last year. 'I'm just your average dude', he kept saying..."

"Average except for the injuries, I would presume."

"Do not presume so lightly." With a sigh, he finally set down the paper, kicked his rear hooves off the desk, and stood up. "What room is he in?"

"I'll show you." Redheart led the doctor down the emergency. It wasn't much trouble finding him - a gaggle of doctors and nurses had already gathered outside his room, looking in. Nurse Redheart and Doctor Horse joined them to get a better look.

There he was. It was creepy, looking at his featureless green face, you could almost see a pained expression on him. He refused to lay down on his cot. Instead, he held his knee to his barrel with those 'fingers' of his, and rocked back and forth, seeming to emit some cyclical noise of agony.

"It's not natural," Doctor Horse said, with a volume that dared to be heard through the door. "And it's a drain on our resources. Every time his kind show up, they just get themselves injured, get some free medicine, courtesy of Equestria, and then they run off with trouble-makers to go get themselves injured again."

"Or worse," a nurse mumbled, hiding her smirk behind a hoof. "Pregnant."

Doctor Horse blanched. "Oh, thank you. I guess that'll be in my head forever."

"As inconvenient as it may be," Redheart began, "we have an obligation to help all who enter this hospital, do we not?"

A round of grumbling agreement went around the gaggle. "Nopony's saying we don't!" Dr. Bonesaw objected.

"I am," Doctor Horse said, causing all eyes to turn towards him - many in a displeased manner. "Times are changing. The town is embracing democracy. The future is staring us in the face, and the cup may not run over forever." He effected the motion of holding something out, then turning it upside down. "Let it spill. I propose we throw out these freeloading aliens - this one and all the rest. The way their luck tends to go, we may be doing them a favour, anyway."

Redheart could hardly believe what was being said, and looked on in horror and rage. But, as nopony objected, and the nurses and doctors alike began to nod at what they were hearing, she realized this was completely, entirely real.

And she wasn't sure how strongly she disagreed.
