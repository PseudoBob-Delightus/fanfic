Pinkie bounces up to the group of ponies that had just voted on her request and stops them. "Hey, can you guys do me a favor?"

They recognize her and a different pony than before steps forward, "Hello, miss."

"Thank you for agreeing with me, Fluttershy is so cute. But, I need another voteâ€¦"

"You have come to the right place, we can help you indeed."

Pinkie smiles. "Awesome."

"What vote do you seek to answer?"

Pinkie blushes. "Well, I kinda maybe sorta accidentally have a crush on Fluttershy."

"I see."

"Sooooo, I wanted to know if I should ask her out? Can you vote on that?"

"We can, we can."

Pinkie starts gushing about Fluttershy. "I like her so much. I love how kind she is. She's so cute and pretty, and she makes me smile all the time. I was so shocked when she said I was cuter. She's so humble. And did I mention cute?"

The pony smiles. "Let's decide this mare's muse."

"Oh, thank you all. I could have deferentially just asked her out, but what would the fun in that be without getting a bunch of strangers involved in your love life."

With that the vote began. the pony gave a look to the voters that said, *You know what to vote for.*
