It was around lunchtime when Twilight Sparkle was first seen sitting outside eating her lunch. It's every day with that mare. Always with the lunch at lunchtime. Predictable. Twilight Sparkle, eating lunch. Sitting there with her lunch, and her wings.

It caught the attention of a nearby table.

"That's Twilight Sparkle, isn't it?" one stallion whispered.

"It is," the mare he was dining with confirmed. "But something is different about her. I can't quite place my hoof on it."

"I was just thinking the same thing."

"Did she change her bangs?" a stallion at an entirely different table asked.

"No, surely not. If she hasn't realized that those things look terrible on her by now, she never will."

"You know what I think?" yet another mare at yet another table asked. "I think it's the wings."

"The wings?"

"Hey, wait."

"Yeah, it's gotta be."

"Did she always have those?"

"Where did she get those?"

"That's not fair, I want wings!"

"Um, you know I can hear all of you, right?"

Twilight raised her voice, the flat, disappointed tone making all others fall silent. Every pony at every table surrounding her was staring directly at her. Her and her wings. And her lunch.

"Where'd you get those wings, Twilight Sparkle?"

"Oh, I got them from–!"

"No no, me first! Twilight Sparkle, who do you think you are? Why don't *I* have wings but you do?!"

"That's–!"

"I have wings."

"Not everything has to be about you, Cloud Chaser."

"Look, everypony, if you would all just calm down we could easily–!"

"I don't think you should have those wings."

For a brief moment, both the crowd and Twilight fell silent.

"W-what?"

"Yeah," one voice agreed. "I liked her better when she didn't have 'em."

"I don't know, I think she's earned the right to enjoy them."

"Do we even have a right to criticize another mare's wings?"

"Absolutely, when the mare in question doesn't deserve them."

"This is getting ridiculous," Twilight mumbled. Her escape would have been easy, were it not for the crowd actively surrounding her. Sure, she could have teleported away, but then there wouldn't be a conflict with which to vote on. "H-hey!"

"Have you ever heard of 'democracy,' Twilight Sparkle?"

"Of course I have. It was invented by John Democracy in 1523 BC (before Celestia)."

"Good. We learned about it this morning."

"Well, that's lovely. I really should be going, though."

"I say we vote on it. Who's with me?"

The crowd roared. Hooves were stomped. Lunches were eaten. Questions were raised and subsequently ignored. Twilight's voice was drowned out by the excitement, and a vote was cast.

Should Twilight Sparkle's wings be taken from her?
