Posted on a Ponyville doorframe, a notice inexplicably reads:

> This story progresses in real-time based on user interaction. The primary means of interaction is the Like button.
> 
> While a Proposition vote is ongoing, adding a Like to this story will be counted as a vote ***in favour of*** the Proposition. Within the same period, removing a Like from this story will be counted as a vote ***against*** the Proposition. 
> 
> No other interactions are counted as votes, but they may influence the story in other ways.
> 
> Use this power wisely.

Despite much roadside debate, nopony is quite sure what it means.
