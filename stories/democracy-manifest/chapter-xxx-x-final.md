It only took a night before she realized that this whole trip had been an overreaction. Sure, she was having a bad day yesterday, but she'd had many over the years. Some in recent memory were filled with tragedy and disaster, even. But she hadn't left then. Why now? 

The question kept her up overnight, and the answer never came.

All that said, she was glad she'd taken a *short* break. It gave her time to realize what she valued in a town like Ponyville. There was stability, for one - most days in Ponyville were just the same as every other day. And there was community - ponies knowing all their neighbours, respecting and trusting each other, and relying on each other as needed. You didn't get this in a big city or a tourism destination. This only happened in the small towns, the rural heartlands, the places you needed to take long train rides to and from.

The whistle shrieked through the evening air, and the sound of the brakes engaging made her teeth vibrate something fierce, *but still*, Mayor Mare thought to herself, *it's good to be back*.

The first thing she did when she stepped out of the train car and onto the station was trip on the steps and fall flat on her face. That certainly wasn't what she had intended to do - it just seemed like the steps weren't where they should have been. Rubbing her snout, she examined the station's steps and found that they were about two or three inches away from where they *should* have been, from where they've *always* been.

"Hm," she said, to nopony, "that's odd."

Then she turned around, and saw the great welcome sign hanging over the archway to the train station. On that sign the words read: 'WELCOME TO TOWNY MCTOWNFACE.'

She decided not to think about that one too hard. "Seems they've done some... um... redecorating?"

However, once she made the short walk over the hill to where she could look down on the usually peaceful, quiet town, she found the whole place deserted, destroyed, or actively on fire. What few structures remained were all in the wrong place - particularly Twilight's castle, which now stood in the middle of the market square.

 How in Tartarus had *that* happened? She wondered if there was anypony left who could answer.

Taking her first ginger steps down the hill and into town, she had to climb over charred ruins of buildings, voting booths, and even the occasional toppled lemonade stand. It felt as if she might have been retracing her steps from the previous day, but in reverse, and through wholly alien terrain. This was no village; it was a hellscape of fire and brimstone and bad political slogans.

Through the market square, under that imposing, newly-positioned crystal edifice; past the schoolyard, where foals' laughter no longer echoed; and across streets and alleys totally devoid of even the less nostalgic of annoyances. 

Eventually, confused and bewildered, Mayor Mare happened upon a familiar sight: a black-coated bull stuck in a drinking well. For a moment things seemed out of time. *Didn't I show some ponies how to pull him out, just minutes ago?*, she wondered. But no, that was yesterday. There were no ponies here. Only her, the well, and the well's unwilling occupant.

Without anything better to say, she just asked, "What happened?"

The bull looked at her with a forlorn expression and said, "They didn't pull me out."

That was an illuminating answer, kind of, but not the one she was hoping for. "No, I mean... like, generally. What the hay happened to *Ponyville*?"

"Ah," the bull said. "That'd be the democracy, then. 

"Democracy happened."
