Pinkie smiles. "that was fun!"

the group of ponies wishes her luck before leaving.

Pinkie rushes back to Fluttershy, finding her where she left her.

"Fluttershy!"

"Pinkie?"

"Fluttershy!"

"Pinkie?"

Pinkie hugs Fluttershy, ending the cycle before it truly could begin.

Fluttershy hugs back and says, "I love you…"

"I love you, too!"

Fluttershy hugs tighter.

Pinkie nuzzles Fluttershy before the hug ends.

"What's going on, Pinkie?"

Pinkie blushes. "Well, I really really like you… and I wanted to ask you something."

Fluttershy giggles. "I really like you too! And I can answer your question."

"Fluttershy, will you go out with me?"

Fluttershy blushes. "Yes! I'd love to."

Pinkie cheers. "Yay!"

Fluttershy takes a page from her new marefriend and tackles her with a hug.

Pinkie rebounds with a hug of her own, holding Fluttershy tight.

They sit up still hugging.

Fluttershy whispers, "I wanted to ask you out, I might have if you didn't ask me first."

Pinkie whispers back, "How could I not ask you out, you're so cute."

Fluttershy giggles. "I still think you are cuter."

Pinkie giggles. "I love you!"

Fluttershy replies, "I love you too!"
