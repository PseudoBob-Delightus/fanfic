"Pull!" Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie pulled.

"Push!" Applejack and Twilight Sparkle pushed.

Despite their combined efforts, Fluttershy remained firmly lodged in the doorway. Finally they all gave up in one combined groan.

"Ugh, how is she so strong?" asked an exhausted Rainbow Dash.

"Is it..." Applejack hesitated to wonder. "Is it something she *eats*?"

Twilight tried again to reason with the mare. "Fluttershy, please, just, come with us? Nothing's going to happen!"

"B-b-b-but... Th-th-th-the sto-o-o-ory!" Fluttuttershy stuttuttered. "It'll expl-pl-pl-plode!"

"No it won't!" Twilight cried. "At least, not just because you step outside! It's still," - she peeked outside - "nineteen hours away."

"Nineteen...?!"

"Yes." Twilight said. "I'm not sure how you trailed off into an interrobang, but yes. Nineteen hours."

"Hey, that's just how she talks!" Pinkie Pie piped up. "Leave her out of this!"

"How can I leave her out of this? She's the reason we're here!"

"Oh no! A-a-a-arguments!!!"

Rainbow Dash shook her head, wiped some sweat from her brow, and then pointed outside over Fluttershy's shoulder. "Hey look! An animal!"

Fluttershy dropped down to the floor. "Where?"

Then, in one smooth, gentle motion, Rainbow Dash tackled Fluttershy and threw her onto her own lawn. It took a moment before she realized she was outside, but when she did, her eyes slowly tracked upwards.

"Eep."
