Fluttershy frowns as the votes don't come in. "Aw, that's okay… maybe it's for the better…"

The mare says, "I'm sorry, miss."

The group of ponies move on as Fluttershy slowly trots back to where her and Pinkie were earlier. Pinkie is still there and greets her with a smile.

This makes Fluttershy feel a little better and she half smiles.

Pinkie grabs her and hugs her tightly. "I love you!"

Her smile grows to a full one. "Aww, I love you too, Pinkie. What's up?"

After the hug, Pinkie stares at Fluttershy with a warm smile. "I really like you."

Fluttershy blushes and looks at the ground with a faltering smile. "I really like you too…"

Pinkie takes Fluttershy's hoof and holds it in her own hooves. "I *Really* like you. I… wanted to ask you something."

Fluttershy perks up. She looks Pinkie in the eyes, awaiting.

Pinkie blushes. "Fluttershy, will you go out with me?"

Fluttershy's mouth opens, agape in shock. She recovers before tightly hugging Pinkie. "Yes!"

Pinkie hugs back and breathes a sigh of relief. "Yay!"

Fluttershy sighs. "I wanted to ask you out, but I didn't have the confidence. I'm sorry."

Pinkie hugs tighter. "You don't need to apologize. I found the confidence for both of us!"

Fluttershy giggles. "Thank you."

Pinkie says, "I love you!"

Fluttershy replies, "I love you, too!"
