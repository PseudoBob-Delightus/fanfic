Desert Sands was good.

On a high-level surface analysis, the technical quality is excellent and the bulk of the text is vivid and imaginative but fairly long-winded. Maybe the first curiosity was that 16,092 words were not rounded down to a cleaner number. Zeroes in the word count aren't very important, and won't make the story better, but they can often indicate a level of discipline that most authors lack. The first half of the story does better in this regard: the flowing language is new and interesting, yet fairly reserved. Take this, the third paragraph:

> There was never a reprieve from the blistering sunbeams that charred her fur and flesh, no shade or promise of shade. And no matter how far Luna gazed into the distance, she could only find rusty reds and burnt oranges.

Inject this into my veins, please.

However, the flowing language continues all the way through the story, even into familiar contexts - like a revisit of the same location or idea - that ought to be described more simply, because the pace quickens after introductions, and because the reader ideally remembers how that first description felt. And it's not a matter of simple word choice or sentence-level efficiency, but a matter of narrative focus, I think. This is true even in the first half, but more applicable in the second. Nevertheless, the descriptive text was integrated into the almost poetic flow of things very well, so well that I sometimes forgot I was being described to.

Now I'll get into the meat of things. Which also means re-reading the story so I'm sure I understood it correctly. There but for the grace of God...

The core conflict, as I understand it, is a multi-dimensional one between Celestia and Luna, and between the sisters and Nightmare Moon. Existing circumstances and simmering anger drive Celestia and Luna apart, and the spirit within Luna's dreams works at all hours to corrupt her mind and convince her to abandon that partnership and assert herself as the superior of the two, at least, if not just kill her sister and take complete control of Equestria. This conflict hits its flashpoint when Nightmare Moon finds Luna too loving of Celestia to betray her, even after weeks of torment, so it possesses Luna's body and tries to do its own dirty work. The resolution of this conflict seems naturally like it should involve Celestia and Luna re-learning the value of their bond, and trusting each other enough to work together and conquer the force that divides them. This possibility is even hinted at in the story - Celestia is capable of visiting dreams, just as Luna is. However, that doesn't happen. Really the opposite occurs: Celestia defeats Nightmare Moon with brute force, and Luna despairs at her non-betrayal (since she was never in control during Nightmare Moon's rampage) enough to attempt suicide and spare the chance that the corrupting spirit should survive. Yet she herself survives, by the grace of the Elements, with the spirit... dormant? And the sisters get an opportunity to rebuild their relationship in the meantime.

I really loved the introduction and the scenes of torment. The build-up of resentment and waking nightmares up to the reveal was slow, excruciating, and excellent. It loses a bit of focus and momentum when Luna finally has her conversation with Nightmare Moon, but even that still is compelling. For a good quarter or even a third of the story, it seemed like anything could happen.

However, things change once fighting breaks out. The core conflict can't be resolved by combat of any kind, and it largely doesn't work out as a metaphor for the character moments happening within it - except for the part where Celestia spares Luna, near the end. And in terms of the action being compelling for its own sake, well, the geography of the magical fight scene is hard to understand, since the layout of the castle/city was never explored before it all started getting destroyed. Additionally, it isn't clear how the action can progress beyond its initial moments - when, apparently, they were both holding back. What can 'spears as black as the night sky' do that none of Nightmare Moon's other spells can? Without a feel for the weight of these things, I don't get the sense that anything is an escalation over anything else, so not only is it unclear what 'holding back' means, it's also generally unclear what the reader should expect from any particular attack.

Specifically about the part where Celestia is pierced by a spike: Why should this matter? It's been shown multiple times that they can both heal from grievous wounds. A spike through the chest is quite bad, yeah, but not 'would kill an immortal with a healing factor' bad. There needs to be an understanding of not only the powers at play, but the *rules* of these powers, especially their limits, before something like this can have serious emotional weight to it. This is pretty much just a notable extension of my previous thoughts on combat.

Finally, the cycle of apologies and coming-to-terms at the end, as they come to understand each others' perspectives and take steps to resolving the conflict, is overlong. Some of this is stuff the reader already knows, while some is stuff that should have been handled earlier, for example during the climax. It pains me to say it, but I wonder if Luna simply waking up to the embrace of her sister, and crying into her shoulder, would have been a sufficient ending. Or even a better one.

The conflicts I interpreted earlier, between Celestia and Luna, and between the sisters and Nightmare Moon, are half-solved. Nightmare Moon is done in by the Elements, which is unsatifying, but it was only a device all along, so, sure. The more important conflict for the story remains, and gets a more natural conclusion at the end. Celestia and Luna still have to work to repair their relationship. Presumably this fails in the distant future, if we aren't diverging from canon, but alas: nothing lasts forever.

This review must seem endlessly negative, but I think the story was good, overall. I wouldn't have nearly as much criticism if I thought it was shit. And I am of course plenty guilty of these problems and worse in my own work, so don't think I'm trying to put you down.

Hopefully this helps. Good work, and I hope to read more from you.
