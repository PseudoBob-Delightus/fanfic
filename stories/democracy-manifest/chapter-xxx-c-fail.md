Sunset came and went, and the Royal Guard descended into town.

Many guards pounded the doors of citizens known to have participated in democracy; and when they wouldn't answer, the doors were knocked down, the ponies were dragged out of their homes, and they were all given a stern talking to about 'loyalty' and 'obligation' and 'not fomenting rebellion'. This talking-to usually continued until the pony said they were sorry and promised not to do it again.

But some were not so easily cowed. Masked and cloaked, they hid their identity, which led to many guards addressing them as 'you there!' while trying to stop them from jumping across rooftops and so forth. Mainly because jumping across rooftops was dangerous if you weren't a pegasus.

When one of them was caught, their identity was almost revealed - but another, eavesdropping, dropped from the eaves and saved them by viciously throwing a banana cream pie in the guard's face. They both ran away, shouting the motto of their order:

"For Democracy!"

One guard looked to the other, who was trying to clean meringue out of his mane, and said, "This is gonna be a long day, huh?"
