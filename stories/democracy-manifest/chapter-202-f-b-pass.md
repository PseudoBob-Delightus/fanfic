Fluttershy smiles as she gains the confidence to ask out her crush.

"Thank you all," she says to them.

The group of ponies wish her farewell and leave.

Fluttershy trots back to where she and Pinkie were earlier. Pinkie is still there.

"Pinkie?" Fluttershy asks.

"Hi, Fluttershy!" Pinkie says.

Fluttershy tries to take Pinkie's hoof and hold it, but Pinkie hugs her before she can.

"I love you, Fluttershy."

"I love you too. What's up?" Fluttershy asks.

After the hug, Pinkie stares at Fluttershy with a warm smile. "I really like you."

"I really like you too. Actually, that's why I came back. I had something I wanted to ask you…"

"Oh, what is it? I love questions!"

Fluttershy blushes. "Pinkie, will you… go out with me?"

Pinkie's face lights up more than it already was. "Yes!"

Fluttershy pulls Pinkie into another hug as both mares smile and blush.

Pinkie giggles. "You know, I was about to ask you out, but you beat me to it."

Fluttershy giggles too. "I asked you out because those ponies voted and it gave me the confidence to do it."

Pinkie says, "That was very nice of them."

Fluttershy squeezes Pinkie in the hug. "I love you."

Pinkie nuzzles Fluttershy. "I love you, too!"
