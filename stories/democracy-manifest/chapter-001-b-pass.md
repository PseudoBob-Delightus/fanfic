Hooves were raised. 'Aye's were said. Tears were shed. Democracy in action was a beautiful thing.

"Well, that's good," the stallion said. "Now I can finally paint this thing."

The pegasus came forward from the congratulatory crowd with her head held low. "Hay. I'm sorry for pressing you on this democracy stuff."

The stallion shook his head. "Nah, it's fine. I'm just glad you kids are taking it so seriously."

"I'm not a kid," she said, deadly serious. "I'm thirty-two."

"Oh, well sor-ry then. I thought you were younger. Shouldn't that be a compliment, or somethin'?"

"Not exactly..."

"Fine. I am glad you all are taking it serious, no matter if you're kids or young adults or whatever, alright? Now just..."

The stallion looked her in the eye.

"Just find somethin' more deservin' of a vote next time, alright?"

The pegasus raised an eyebrow. "Got any ideas?"
