Fluttershy says softly to Pinkie, "I think you're cute…"

Pinkie Pie blushes. "Aww, thanks! But you're way cuter, Fluttershy!"

Fluttershy blushes and tries to clarify. "Oh, I wasn't saying that… um… I do think you are cuter, but…"

Pinkie smiles. "I think you're cuter."

Fluttershy looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. "Okay…"

As it so happens a crowd began to form around the two ponies.

A pony steps out from the crowd and asks, "Excuse me, do you ponies need help deciding something?"

Pinkie lights up. "Yes! I think Fluttershy is cuter, but she thinks I'm cuter! But we can't *both* be cuter! How do we know who's the cutierest?"

The pony replies, "We should hold a vote!"

Pinkie replies, "What's a vote?"

The pony explains the premise to the pair of ponies, and they agree to hold a vote.

"Now, what are we actually voting on?"

Pinkie Pie explains, "I think Fluttershy is cuter, and she thinks I'm cute. We need to know who is cuter!"

The pony asks Pinkie, "Well, whats your argument for why she is cuter?"

Pinkie blushes again. "Can't you see it from just looking at her? She's sooooo cute, she's pretty, and she's so shy and timid. She makes the best tea I've ever had and she's my bestest friend."

The pony turns to Fluttershy. "Why do you think she is cuter?"

Fluttershy gulps before saying, "She's so much cuter, she's so vibrant and colorful, she has such beautiful eyes, and she always cheers me up when I'm sad. She has the cutest smile and she's so soft and cuddly."

The blush on Fluttershy's face takes over and she goes into hiding in her mane.

Pinkie chimes in, "She's even cute when she's hiding away!"

The pony spoke up again. "We shall decide who of you is the cutest pony by decree of democracy!"

Pinkie asks, "So, you all just raise a hoof if you think I'm cuter?"

"Yes. All ponies present, raise your hoof up if you think Pinkie Pie is cuter than Fluttershy. Leave your hoof down if you think Fluttershy is cuter!"

"I vote Pinkie…" Fluttershy says softly. Pinkie giggles.
