"Thanks for inviting me out to lunch, Carrot Top," Lyra said as she sat down at one of the tables located in the Ponyville Café's outdoor seating area. 

"Don't mention it. I just thought we could use an outing together to make up for last week. I mean, I know that plenty of ponies like carrots, but my stand hadn’t been *that* busy in what seems like forever. Guess it couldn't hurt to lower my prices a bit if the demand is so high," she replied.

"'Friendship is stronger than the boundaries imposed by scheduling issues'...or something like that," offered the lyre aficionado.

Carrot Top sat down across from her dining companion. "That sounds just like something Twilight would say."

"You're right on the mark there, as I overheard her say something similar to Rarity a couple of days ago. There was more to it, but she started using words even *I* haven't heard of," Lyra said, with a touch of unease.

"That mare and her dictionary, amirite?", smirked the earth pony of the two. “Dang, I'm hungry. Wonder what specials they have here today?" She picked up her menu and flipped through its pages until she found a laminated insert slipped between the salads and the sandwich section. "Hey, listen to this."

"What?" 

"They're offering something called a Licked, which appears to be a favorite sandwich of Pegasopolis that's made its way to Ponyville recently", she continued.

Lyra stared at Carrot Top with a look of pure confusion on her face. "I sincerely hope by that name you don't mean the sandwich is anywhere near *somepony's tongue* while it's being prepared."

The carrot farmer had to stifle some laughter because of what she just heard. "Ha! No, not at all, but you can blame me for making you think that. I honestly have no idea why I did, but I read an acronym like it was just a normal word. I would assume it's actually called an LHCT, which is just like your usual hay, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, except for the addition of grilled catfish."

"*Phew*," exhaled the mint-colored mare, "that is certainly a lot more reasonable than what my ears were telling me the first time. Still, whoever chose to put those letters in that order should be ashamed of themself."

"Yeah, CHLT was right there for the taking," agreed Carrot Top. "Anyways, that actually sounds pretty good. Do you have any idea what you're going to order?"

Staring intently at the menu held in her magic, Lyra reluctantly admitted that she didn't. "I always have trouble at restaurants. The sandwich you mentioned sounds like it would be interesting, but then again, the Caesar salad this place makes is quite literally one of the best things I've ever eaten. At least this place doesn't serve food from Azteca, because the endless varieties of burritos *alone* are enough to overwhelm me."

"Do you think you could narrow your options down to just the sandwich and salad?" 

Lyra thought for a moment. "I could do that. I mean, even if I didn't *want* to do that, it would at least make things easier for me."

"Well in that case, why don't we take the opportunity to try out this "voting" thing that stallion mentioned earlier?" replied the orange-maned mare, glad that her query had been answered in the way she had hoped it would be. 

"That sounds like it might be fun. If you come up with a statement to vote on, I'll abide by its results," answered the pony in search of food.

"Should Lyra order the CHLT—I mean the *LHCT*—for lunch?" Carrot Top raised her hoof and said, "Aye".

Simultaneously, Lyra did absolutely nothing. 

"Wait, if you didn't say 'Aye', and I did, doesn't that make the vote a tie?" 

"Having only two ponies be party to this decision may not have been the best course of action," Lyra discerned. She looked around to see how many other ponies were near their table. Between the other outdoor seating arrangements, a waiter, and a few passers-by, there seemed to be enough present for a repeat of the same outcome to be avoided. Crucially, if they all were to cast a vote, there would be an *odd* number of ponies, so a tie would be impossible.

Getting up out of her seat, she said, "Pardon me for the interruption, but Carrot Top and I attempted to take a vote on if I should order the new LHCT sandwich instead of a Caesar salad for lunch, and it resulted quite pitifully in a tie. Would anypony be willing to also give their opinion on the matter, so that a recurrence is out of the question?"

Carrot Top muttered to herself, "...and she said *Twilight* used too many big words."

As most ponies in town had been at least somewhat intrigued by the system that had been introduced to the town earlier in the day, various statements of agreement were shared from all of them.

Happy that everypony had decided to help solve her problem, Lyra commenced the voting process.

"Okay then, anypony who thinks I should order the sandwich, raise your hooves and say "Aye".
