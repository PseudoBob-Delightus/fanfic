Appointed Rounds burst into the sorting room of the Ponyville post office, a puff of her purple feathers floating about. "Did you hear about this 'voting' thing?"

Rainy Day and Ditzy Doo looked up from the packages and traded an uncertain look. In Ditzy's case, the same look was directed at Appointed. "Don't we vote for the mayor?" she said.

Appointed tilted her head. "Why would we do that?"

Ditzy scrunched her muzzle. "Well, what am I doing every fall?"

Rainy flicked her sky-blue wings "You mean the muffin basket you bring her every year?"

That got a wingshrug. "How else should I vote for her?"

"Well, apparently she's on vacation or something." Appointed spread her forehooves. "Now the whole town's voting on everything!"

"Oh." Ditzy bit her lip. "I don't know if I can afford that many muffin baskets."

"No, no, we just have to say 'aye' and if enough ponies do, the motion passes."

"That's what bran muffins are for."

Appointed rolled her eyes. "As in the thing we're voting on."

The other mailmares shuddered, tails pressed against their backsides. "Politics really *has* gone too far," said Rainy.

"Look, I'll show you: All who think we should we keep working for the day, say 'aye.'"

Ditzy looked at Appointed like she'd grown an extra head. "Of course we should. The mail stops for nopony."

"You were *named* after the oath." Rainy drew herself up, eyes shut as she recited from memory. "'Neither rain nor snow nor gloom of night will keep these messengers from their appointed rounds.'"

"'Do not ask us about hail, fog, Mrs. Cake, hydras, dragons, centaurs, Mrs. Cake, windigoes, sleet, extradimensional invasions, or Mrs. Cake,'" Ditzy continued, just as solemnly.

"Think we take her off the oath?"

Ditzy shuddered. "Only when we're *sure* they won't try for more foals. That mare was scary ten months in."

Rainy turned back to Appointed. "But yeah, I don't think we can vote to take a day off."

"Sure we can! We're government workers, aren't we?" Appointed tapped her hat. "It's the *Royal* Mail, after all."

The others thought about that for a few moments. Rainy spoke up first. "I think that means we'd have to get back to work if Twilight Sparkle asked."

Appointed rolled her eyes. "Fine. Motion to take a break until Twilight asks?"

"That's a long motion," said Ditzy. "You should really eat more fiber."

"Just say aye if you agree."
