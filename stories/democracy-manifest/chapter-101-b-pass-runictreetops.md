"W-wait, you can't just take my wings!"

"Sure we can," a stallion happily responded. "That's what democracy decided."

"N-noooooooooooooooo!"

Twilight's cries were ignored as the crowd ripped the conspicuous bucket out of her hooves. Tears filled her eyes, but none cared. They were too focused on the wings the gluttonous mare was about to consume.

"Areâ€¦ are these *boneless*?!"

"What's wrong with that?! I don't like picking around them!"

"And that smell!" Another mare covered her nose and stepped away from the bucket. "Is that *BBQ*?!"

"BBQ?! Twilight, what in Equestria do you think you're doing?! You think you deserve to have wings when you use sweet sauce rather than spicy? Not even a mild buffalo?!"

"I can't handle spicy foods!" Twilight sobbed. "I just wanted my luuuuuuuuunch!"

"If this is what you were going to be eating, perhaps you're better off waiting for dinner."

A nod, then another. Even those in the crowd that wished for the hungry mare to keep her wings found themselves persuaded. Twilight Sparkle did not deserve those wings, and they had democracy to thank for proving so.

Thus, lunch in Ponyville passed by, and no further issues arose. At least, not until the next issue arose.

Those ponies. Always with the lunch.
