Pinkie Pie stands shocked as she see the fact that she won. "How am I cuter?"

The ponies that voted for her shouted out a few reasons.

"You're hair is so fluffy."

"You're smile is so infectious."

"You're colors are so pretty."

The group began to leave as Pinkie turned to Fluttershy.

Pinkie hugs Fluttershy. "I'm so surprised."

Fluttershy giggles and hugs back. "I'm not."

After the hug is over, Fluttershy looks back at the group that had decided and makes a decision. "Pinkie, I need to go for now, I'll see you later?"

Pinkie smiles, "Okay, Fluttershy, bye!"

"Bye, Pinkie the cute!"
