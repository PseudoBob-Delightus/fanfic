"The ayes, unfortunately, *don't* have it..." Poppyseed admitted. "Sorry, folks, but it looks like that's that."

Many of the voters, one way or another, seemed dissatisfied with this outcome. One asked, "Can't we just... you know, do it anway?"

"No way!" Sunflower cried, which was probably the most emotion she's put into anything. "You can't, like, change the outcome, babe. That's literally what democracy means."

"Drat."

"Hay, umm, can I get out of the catapult now...? If it wouldn't be too much trouble..."

"Yeah, fine," Poppyseed said, "Whatever."

"Thanks..."

As she stepped out, she happened to knock the pin out of the locking hook. The catapult seemed to heave upwards, bending and twisting, but it stayed groaning in this shape just long enough that Fluttershy could step free. Once she was on the ground, the siege engine released, launching an empty bucket in a semicircular arc up, across, and down; the arm slammed into the cobblestone ground of the town square and kicked up a bit of rubble, and the rest of the device collapsed in a somersaulting heap.

"Oh, *come on*!" Poppyseed groaned. "That would have been so awesome with you in it!"

"Sorry," Fluttershy squeaked.
