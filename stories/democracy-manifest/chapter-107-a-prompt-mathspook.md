The moment Twilight stepped outside, she knew something was wrong. There were crowds of ponies talking. Their hooves went up. Their hooves went down. More talking. More hooves.

She scrunched her brow together. Whatever this was, it wasn't right. This was not the way Ponyville was supposed to be.

Cautiously, silently, Twilight crept through an alley. She needed information. Were the ponies under an evil curse? Quaking in fear from a dangerous monster? Had Sugarcube Corner run out of pastries?

A loud voice from the crowd carried into the alley. "See, that's the problem with this democracy thing. It's just a glorified opinion poll. It never makes anything meaningful happen."

Democracy? In Ponyville? In Equestria? Impossible, thought Twilight. Equestria was ruled by Princesses. They were personally responsible for everything. Except for the things they delegated. Which were most things. Come to think of it, they seemed to avoid making decisions whenever they could. Last time she tried to get Princess Celestia to make a decision, she was told that the Princess was "getting a hooficure" for four hours.

Another voice said, "I bet we can make something meaningful happen right now."

"You can't even make Twilight Sparkle get rid of the library's late fees."

"Because her head would explode."

Her head would not explode! She had half a mind to go out there right now and—no, it was too dangerous. The crowd might look safe, but once you believed in eliminating library late fees, you were only a small step away from committing treason. She could feel herself getting hot with anger. Treason! Traitors! The thought gave her a headache. There was an awful, terrible pressure building inside her skull, one so powerful that it felt like her head was about to—

The next thing Twilight knew, she was lying on the ground, and there was a crowd of concerned ponies around her.

"You okay?" asked Hughbert Jellius.

"Remember Equestria," she murmured.

"What's she talking about?"

Sea Swirl said, "You think she knows about the library late fee vote?"

Twilight Sparkle said, "Please. For Equestria."

"Does that mean you're for it or against it?"

But Twilight had already passed out again. Hughbert Jellius said, "Someone get her to the hospital. In the meantime, let's take a vote. Who's in favor of abolishing library late fees?"
