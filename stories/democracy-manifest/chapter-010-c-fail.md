"I don't think you should send the letter!" the quill replied, in a voice that sounded suspiciously like Twilight Sparkle's own voice.

"Me neither!" the paper agreed.

"Well, then, I know exactly what I'm going to do," Twilight said. "You know I never follow advice."

"What about advice from one of your *real* friends?" one of them asked.

Twilight pressed them both flat on the desk. "Hay, who said that!"

None of them made another sound.

"That's what I thought. Obviously I would have gotten help from my *real* friends, but they're all wrapped up in this democracy business, too. Got anything to say to *that*?"

Twilight stared at the feather quill and the sheet of paper. Both were looking a bit disheveled from being pressed onto the desk so suddenly, but little else was amiss.

"Good. Now, get writing."

A moment passed as Twilight almost forgot that she was, in fact, talking to a pair of inanimate objects. But then she remembered, and wrote the message her own self.
