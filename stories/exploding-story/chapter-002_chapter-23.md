Twilight returned to the park where she'd had her meltdown, and somehow found the same stallion she'd screamed at a few minutes ago. He noticed her, then noticed Spike by her side - and that seemed to jog his memory.

"Hey, Spike! And Twilight Sparkle," he said. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," she said. "I just didn't notice that was up there."

He looked up. "That?"

"Yeah, that."

"No, I mean, what do you mean 'that'?"

"Uh..." Twilight was starting to wonder if he was being intentionally dull. "You know, that giant title hanging above us?"

He looked back up and squinted. "I see... a line. No words on it though."

Twilight looked up and saw the title. Then she walked over to where he was standing and looked up.

"Well, horseapples," she said once more.
