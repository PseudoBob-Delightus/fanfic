Poppyseed and Sunflower were sitting at a cute little market cafe, chewing bubblegum and taking up space, when one said to the other, "Oh my gosh, Sunflower, did you see *that*?"

The reply was thus: "Huh? Like, what?"

"*That*!" Poppyseed pointed conspicuously to a yellow-coated, pink-maned pegasus trying desperately to remain inconspicuous. The mere act of pointing at her was enough to scare her nearly out of her skin and send her running for the hills (beyond which she lived). "That prissy pegasus!"

"Oh, Fluttershy's not, like, prissy," Sunflower argued. "I went to school with her. Sure, she may be shy, and fussy, and a loner, and a freak, and a total baddie, but she's not, like, *prissy*."

"Hay, what was that last thing you said?"

"She's a freak, babe. She, like, talks to animals, and stuff. It's... freaky."

Poppyseed didn't think that was the *last* thing Sunflower had said, but it was certainly true. "Oh my gosh, what a freak."

For a moment longer they both sat there, chewing bubblegum and taking up space.

"Hay, Sunflower?"

"Yeah?"

"You know how there's this democracy thing going around?"

"Yeah? Like, what about it?"

Poppyseed thought, and as she thought, she blew a pink bubble that got bigger and bigger until it popped. "What if we went all democracy on her."

"Babe, that's, like, a *crazy* good idea." Another bubble was born; another bubble died. "But, like, what do you mean? I literally have no idea what you mean."

"Do I gotta spell it out? I'm saying we do one of those vote things. And as for the proposal, well..." Chew. Inflate. Pop. "How about we get some of our friends together and show her what we think about her... um... freakishness. And shyness. And even her prissyness, if it turns out she is a little prissy."

"She's *not*, babe," Sunflower grumbled. "But the rest of that sounded pretty good. It can be, like, one of those angry mob situations, from the plays, you know?"

"We wouldn't be an angry mob! We would be a super friendly, super orderly mob. Hardly a mob at all."

"In that case, you got, like, my vote."

Poppyseed admitted, "Maybe a little bit mob-like."

"Babe, you got my vote already. You don't have to, like, keep selling me on it."

"Right. Let's go ask some more ponies."
