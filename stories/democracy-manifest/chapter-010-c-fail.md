Pinkie Pie stands victorious with a smile. "See, I told you you were cuter."

Fluttershy could only hold her hoof to her mouth, still blushing.

The ponies that voted for her shouted out a few reasons.

"You're eyes are so beautiful."

"You're voice is so calming."

"You're nature is so welcoming."

The group began to leave as Fluttershy turned to Pinkie.

Fluttershy hugs Pinkie. "I thought for sure you would win."

Pinkie hugs back. "I knew it was always going to be you."

After the hug is over, Pinkie looks back at the group that had decided and makes a decision. "Fluttershy, I need to go for now, I'll see you later?"

Fluttershy nods. "Bye."

"Bye, Fluttershy the cute!"
