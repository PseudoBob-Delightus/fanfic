# Rainbow x Rarity

I am about to knock on Rarity's door when it opens.

"Oh, Rainbow Dash, just the pony I wanted to see. Would you like to come in?"

"Sure, I had something I needed to talk about."

"I as well."

Rarity leads them over to her couch, where they sit down.

"Were you looking for me because of that?" I point to the title, which is still visible inside, somehow.

"Yes, darling. I was planning on letting this happen naturally, but it appears as somepony has other plans."

"That's kind of why I'm here, too."

"I wanted to spend more time with you…"

I hug her. "Me too."

She hugs back.

I nuzzle her after the hug. "Should I say it?"

She smiles at me, blushing. "Go ahead."

I feel a blush coming over me as I become enthralled by her beauty.

I say, softly, "Rarity, I love you."

Rarity says, serenely, "Rainbow Dash, I love you."

We both take in the moment, staring into each other's eyes.

We both start leaning in, and our lips meet. We kiss passionately, holding each other.

Both our eyes start watering, but neither of us try to hide them.

We break the kiss and hold each other tight.

As I hold her, I whisper, "I've wanted to do this for so long…" My tears continue.

"I have too," Rarity whispers back.

As we let go of the hug, I kiss her cheek, causing her blush to intensify.

She holds my hoof and stares me at, smiling.

I admit, "You know, normally I consider myself number one at everything, but there is one thing I don't mind you being number one at."

"What?"

"You are the most beautiful mare ever."

Her blush grows. "Well, you are the prettiest mare ever."

"Aren't those the same thing?"

"We'll call it a tie, deal?"

"Deal." I pull Rarity into a loving embrace, resting her head on my chest.

Rarity nuzzles her head to my chest. "If this is our last day together, I'm at least glad I am about to spend it with you."

I nuzzle the top of her head. "Me too." I kiss her head.

We sit there in silence for a while, just enjoying each others presence.

I whisper in her ear, "I love you."

She whispers back, "I love you too," before kissing my chest.

My voice weakens. "Do you think Twilight will be able to figure out how to stop it?"

"I sure hope so."

"Me too, Rarity. Me too."
