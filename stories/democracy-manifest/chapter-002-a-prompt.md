He held the hank of rope in his hooves. 

"You think this will work?"

He looked up at the bull, who was still stuck firmly in the well. "I sure hope so," he muttered, before unwinding the rope and tying it around the bull's horns.

"What do you mean 'I sure hope so'?" the bull protested. "The way you said that makes me think it's a big fat 'no'!"

The stallion almost couldn't bear to look him in the face. What could he say? 'I'm sure it'll work'? But he wasn't sure! He'd never pulled a bull out of a well before! Nopony had! The mayor said so herself, right before she left and put everypony else in charge. Without her wisdom and guidance, nothing was a sure thing.

He looked to his companions - other ponies who had come around to help. Sea Swirl was here, a disciple of democracy if ever there was one; and there was Hughbert, the gentlest and stickiest pony he knew. As he thought of them he realized something.

"What's your name, friend?" he asked the bull.

"Huh? Oh, I guess we were never introduced. Herd calls me Shadow, on account of my colour."

"Shadow? That's a pretty cool name," the stallion said.

"I'm Sea Swirl," Sea Swirl said.

"Hughbert," Jellius said.

"And my name's Fine Fettle."

"Fine Fettle..." Shadow felt the name in his mouth. "... Why are we doing that thing that theater characters do before they die?"

"Huh?"

Shadow snorted. "Come on. You know - that thing where the heroes all get together before the final act, or whatever, and they finally get honest with each other and lay their hearts bare and admit things they've been hiding the whole time. And it's supposed to make you sad because you know at least one of them is going to die before the end."

Sea Swirl looked back at Fine Fettle. "Huh. Now that he mentions it, we are definitely doing that, yeah."

"Um." Fine Fettle rubbed his chin. "Well, I don't know. But it felt right, you know?"

"No."

"Sort of."

"Eh..."

"Alright, well, moment's spoiled now. Let's just do this, alright? Who cares if nopony's ever done this before. I'm sure between us, and a few other helpful ponies, we'll make it work."

"You're doing it again."

"Whatever!" Fine Fettle finished the knot on Shadow's horns, and stood back. "Get the vote thing over with."

Sea Swirl cleared her throat, and her voice reached far and wide. "All in favour of pulling Shadow out of the well with a rope, say 'aye'!"
