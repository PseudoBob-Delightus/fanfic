The townsfolk were exhausted after a long day of pushing Ponyville 3 inches to the left.

One pony looked to another and asked, "Hay, what did we get out of pushing Ponyville to the right, anyway?"

The other pony raised their eyebrows. "Wait, you were pushing to the *right*?"

They both looked all around them and noticed that the town was still exactly where it had been before they went through all this trouble.
