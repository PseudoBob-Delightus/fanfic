The votes were in. The 'aye's had it. A tax there would be.

Filthy Rich held his gold-plated lighter to the Zaphzian cigar in Sea Breeze's mouth. "Taste that?" he asked.

She took a puff, which did not mix well with her smoke-free lungs. Despite the coughing fit, she managed to nod and squeeze out the words, "It's good!"

Filthy shot a look at Billfold, who barely contained her laughter. "Not the cigar," he said. "The taste of success. Of *victory*."

"Oh. Yeah. Victory tastes pretty good, I guess. We can always celebrate a victory for democracy."

"For *democracy*, she says!" There came a roaring laugh. "Oh, I like this one."

"Ha ha - what'd I say?"

Hughbert Jellius looked on as the bickering laughter continued, and the cigar at his lips burned. He hadn't taken a drag, not least because of his problems with addiction - it just didn't feel like victory right now.

It felt more like he'd sold his soul.
