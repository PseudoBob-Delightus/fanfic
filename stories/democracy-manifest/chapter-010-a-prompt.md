Fluttershy spoke softly to Pinkie. "I think you're cute…"

Pinkie Pie blushes, saying, "I think you're cuter, Fluttershy."

Fluttershy blushes and tries to clarify. "I wasn't saying that… um… I do think you are cuter, but…"

Pinkie smiles. "I think you're cuter."

Fluttershy accepts this. "Okay."

Pinkie continues, "But, if you think I'm cuter and I think your cuter, how do we know who is the cutest?"

As it so happens a group of ponies stopped in front of the befuddled pair of ponies.

One of them asks, "You look like ponies who could use help deciding something, am I right?"

Pinkie lights up. "Yes, we do need help decided a very important decision. How are you going to help?"

The random pony says, "We can use this magical thing called democracy!"

Fluttershy speaks up. "What's democracy?"

The pony explains the premise to the pair of ponies and they agree to hold a vote.

"Now, what are we actually voting on?"

Pinkie Pie explains, "I think Fluttershy is cuter, and she thinks I'm cute. We need to know who the cutierest is!"

The pony asks Pinkie, "Well, whats your argument for why she is cuter?"

Pinkie blushes again. "Can't you see it from just looking at her? She's sooooo cute, she's pretty, and she's shy and timid. She makes the best tea I've ever had and she's my best friend."

The pony turned to Fluttershy. "Why do you think she is cuter?"

Fluttershy gulps before saying, "She's so much cuter, she's so vibrant and colorful, she has such beautiful eyes and she's so beautiful. She has the cutest smile and she's so soft and cuddly."

The blush on Fluttershy's face had taken over as she went back into hiding of her mane.

Pinkie chimed in. "She's even cute when she's hiding away."

The pony spoke up again. "We shall decide who of you is the cutest pony by decree of democracy."

Pinkie asks, "So, you all just raise a hoof if you think I'm cuter?"

"Yes, all ponies present, please raise your hoof if you think Pinkie Pie is cuter than Fluttershy. Leave your hoof down if you think Fluttershy is cuter!"
