Pinkie Pie laughs. "See, I told you you were cuter!"

Fluttershy's face turned red as she held her hoof to her mouth.

The ponies that voted for her shouted out a few reasons.

"You have the most beautiful eyes!"

"You're so sweet!"

"You're so yellow!"

The group began to leave as Fluttershy turned to Pinkie.

Fluttershy hugs Pinkie. "I thought for sure you would winâ€¦"

Pinkie hugs back and giggles. "I always knew it was going to be you!"

After the hug is over, Pinkie looks back at the group that had decided and makes a decision. "Fluttershy, I need to go for now, I'll see you later?"

Fluttershy nods. "Okay. See you later!"

"Bye, Fluttershy the cute!"
