"So who are you looking for now?"

"Rainbow Dash," Twilight said. They'd started on the trail back to Ponyville. "I figure she's-"

Applejack stopped in her tracks. "Nah, I know how to find her."

"You've seen her?"

"Nah." Applejack simply sat where she stood, took a deep breath, and let out a thunderous call, "GA-A-AY!"

After a few seconds, a streak of rainbow could be seen over the horizon, zeroing in on their position *fast*. At its terminus a pegasus materialized, flaring her wings and scraping her hooves through dirt to slow down. When she finally came to a stop, she asked, "Who called?"
