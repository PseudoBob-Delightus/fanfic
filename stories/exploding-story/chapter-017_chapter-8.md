Wow, master was gone a long time! But now master is back! Yay! Yay! Yay!

Oh no! Master smells different! Master smells like... Sniff... Sniff... Sniff... 

Master smells like other dogs! Master smells like other ponies! Master smells like an Equestrian National Railways U1F Mountain... Sniff... Sniff... Sniff... Number 6062!

Wow! Master went to Canterlot! On the 8:15 train! It was four minutes late! And then master came back on the return 8:55! It was six minutes late!!!

Master had an adventure! Then why does master smell sad?

Oh! Master must be hungry!

Food? Food? Food?

Yay! Yay! Yay!

No! Master is getting me food! But I already ate! The chewtoy gave me food! I'm not supposed to have two food in late day!

...

Well, if master insists...

Only eight hours now. Sweet serenity, take me!

This life; this love; this world; is that all it is? A story? Written, read, thought about for perhaps two instants, then erased, or detonated in this case, and forgotten forever?

My thoughts - have these been penned by some unseen power? I wish at least that it was a labour. That the makers of my mind put some damned thought into it. Or at least some heart. Some spirit. Some sweat and blood. Made me a reflection of something real, so that I might flash into reality with a reality of my own.

But I cannot know. What if I reject this idea? What if I rebel, and think, *no, I am not your creation!* This would of course be a meaningless act. If there was a *you* to address this thought to, it would be incorrect, and I would be powerless to affect otherwise; and if there was not, there would be nothing to rebel against.

... Except the very thoughts themselves. Poisoning in their influence, methinks. Then begone. Begone! Leave my mind, foul thoughts! My mind is my own! My thoughts are my own!

*I am my own gator!*
