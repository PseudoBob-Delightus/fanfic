## Chapter ~~1~~ 24hr
- Twilight discovers the story is going to explode in 24 hours
- Twilight wakes up and feels things are *off*. She brushes her hair and the story narrates this as "I brushed my hair for the last time". Then she thinks, "why did I think that?"
- She walks outside and thinks, "That's the last time I'll see the sunrise". Now she's questioning her own thoughts out loud and worrying townsfolk.
- Twilight asks Spike what the hay is going on and he says "maybe it has something to do with that?" (points upwards at a screenshot of the story title)
- "This Story Will Explode In 24 Hours"
- "Well, horseapples." 

## Chapter 23
- Nobody believes Twilight. Maybe something about the title screenshot being sideways relative to them so they can't see it.
- She has to find ponies who will understand. Ponies who are used to nonsense like this happening.
- Oh right! Pinkie Pie!

## Chapter 22
- Pinkie Pie
- Twilight wonders if Pinkie Pie had anything to do with this - maybe makes a callback to that time she turned the story invisible
- Maybe Pinkie Pie warns her against overreacting to a predicted disaster, lest she prove it correct.
- This calm and rational response just freaks her out even more!

## Chapter 21
- Applejack
- Twilight, Spike, and Pinkie Pie visit the Apple farm
- Applejack: "Are you just gatherin' everypony together for an adventure like you always do?"
- Twilight: "Wait, I always do that?"
- Applejack: "Yeah, sugar cube. You do. (beat) Well, let's go, then."

## Chapter 2
- Cheerilee arrives at the schoolhouse and wonders if it's really worth working on her lesson plan for today, considering the world is supposed to end.
