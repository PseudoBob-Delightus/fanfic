## Chapter 1
- Mayor Mare goes crazy and leaves Ponyville in the ponies' hooves
- Direct democracy first suggested / implemented
## Chapter 2
- Tentative first votes
- "Should this guy paint his fence with white paint?"

## Assorted Ideas
- Helping the bull from chapter 1 get out of the well
- A minor Rainbow Dash story and a minor Applejack story collide. They want passers-by to decide which of them is more attractive, but since it has to be in the form of a proposal, they have to decide which one gets to be the subject of the proposal (i.e. "I propose that Rainbow Dash is prettier than Applejack", or vice versa). This starts a recursive spiral that takes three or four chapters to resolve.
- "Taxation without Representation" - they try to tax themselves so Canterlot will recognize them.
- Twilight hears about the tax thing and figures she'll just correct their misguided idea of the concept, but then she learns what's happening, and goes a little insane. The crowd proposes she shut up.
- Push Ponyville 3 inches to the left (for some reason) feat. Pinkie Pie
- Hospital staff propose throwing Anon out of Ponyville General, due to none of them wanting to treat him for the wounds he received in his Exploding Story chapter. (Or maybe they already treated him for that last year, and "it happened again")
- Form an orderly crowd to hunt Fluttershy down for her crimes of being a passive-aggressive little snob who's not even all that pretty. (if it fails, they form a mob to do the same.)
- Execute Fluttershy.
- Twilight, still going a bit insane from the last thing, has a breakdown at the library and proposes to herself that she leave and get help from Celestia. The target for this would be one vote. She'll do it one way or another.

## Chapters (final)
- The Royal Guard descends on Ponyville and informs the townsfolk that they must abandon democracy or be considered traitors to the Crown and treated accordingly. They have some amount of time (a day?)
- In this time they hold a vote on the proposition of declaring themselves independent from Equestria and initiating an armed rebellion. The vote outcome will mostly just determine how many of them rebel. Success means a lot, failure means only a few. The guard descends regardless.
- Mayor Mare arrives in town in both end scenarios to witness the rebellion getting put down, and various other consequences of the townsfolk's decisions throughout the story. This final result chapter will probably be written in real-time (sort of) and published manually.
