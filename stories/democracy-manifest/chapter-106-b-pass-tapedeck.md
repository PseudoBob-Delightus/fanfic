While the hooves of everypony who took part in the decision-making process were not all raised, the majority still voted for the sandwich due to its newfound popularity in town. Lyra, indecisive as she was, still voted for her salad.

Thanking the others for their time and sitting back down in her chair, the unicorn concluded, "Well, that finally settles it. Seems that you and I will be eating the same lunch today, Goldie."

"You know I hate that nickname," complained the mare in question, her mane not losing an ounce of its bright hue.

"That's why I said it," teased Lyra.

Drinks were served, orders were made, and after a short while, the sandwiches were brought out to their hungry recipients. Carrot Top immediately took a bite of hers, and as any decent mare should, finished swallowing before asking her friend a question. "How does yours taste?"

Lyra took a bite. The bread was in that perfect middle ground between crunchy and soft, the usual fillings it shared with an HLT were delicious, and for this being the first time she had eaten fish as a part of a sandwich, she thought it complemented everything rather nicely. All in all, such a satisfying bite might have even been enough to forgive the poor soul who had named it.

A wrench now thought it had the opportune time to throw itself into the musician's plans. "This sandwich is quite tasty, but *why on earth is it this wet*? You don't think..."

Carrot Top guessed her line of thought and was quick to dissuade such notions. "Lyra, do you honestly think a sandwich like that wouldn't have been reported for a health violation at this point? That isn't *saliva*, you must have just gotten a piece of lettuce that was unnaturally damp."

The sandwich complainer drew a blank for a second. "What is with me and jumping to conclusions today? I say we just forget all about this so we can get back to enjoying ourselves."

"*Thank you*," said Carrot Top, with a sigh of relief.

Non-existent disaster averted, the only problem that remained on Lyra's mind as she continued to eat was that if she now had *two* meals she liked a lot from the Caf√©, wouldn't that just make any future decisions she would have to make when she came here harder?
