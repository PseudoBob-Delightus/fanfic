One of the ponies moaned, "I'm gonna need a second mortgage to pay my late fees."

"Nothing we can do about it now," said Sea Swirl. "We voted."

The first said, "Let's vote again."

"What good would that do?"

"Maybe the vote would turn out better this time."

"That's not how voting works."

Twilight Sparkle was still recuperating from her collapse. The doctor had given her gentle head pats and said, "There, there. It'll be alright." He had assured her that she would feel better just as soon as she recognized ponies' right of self-governance.

A nurse came by pushing a book cart. "Want a book?" asked the nurse. "Makes the time go by much quicker."

"Of course! That's just what I need right nowâ€”" Twilight froze in terror. "These are library books." She opened one. "Overdue library books. Years overdue."

"Oh, we just never bother to return them," said the nurse. "The late fees are too high. After a while, it's cheaper to pretend you lost the book."

"Really? Well, we ought to do something about that."

"They just tried to. No luck."

Twilight shrugged. "Well, it's probably for the best. At least this way, the library will stay well-funded. Wow, that thought makes me feel good! Time to get going!"
