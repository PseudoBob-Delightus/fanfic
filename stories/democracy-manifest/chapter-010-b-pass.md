"I think you should send the letter!" the quill replied, in a voice that sounded suspiciously like Twilight Sparkle's own voice.

"I think so, too!" the paper agreed.

"Wow, thank you so much, you guys," Twilight said, pretending to wipe a tear from her cheek. "I'm glad to have such trustworthy friends as you two."

"But you have real friends, don't you?" one of them said.

Twilight pressed them both flat on the desk. "Hay, who said that!"

None of them made another sound.

"That's what I thought. Obviously I would have gotten help from my *real* friends, but they're all wrapped up in this democracy business, too. Got anything to say to *that*?"

Twilight stared at the feather quill and the sheet of paper. Both were looking a bit disheveled from being pressed onto the desk so suddenly, but little else was amiss.

"Good. Now, get writing."

A moment passed as Twilight almost forgot that she was, in fact, talking to a pair of inanimate objects. But then she remembered, and wrote the message her own self.
