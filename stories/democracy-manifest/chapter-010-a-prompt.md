A discarded flag, or it might have been a plastic bag for all anypony cared, tumbled its way across the ash-charred streets of Ponyville and its incorporeal remains of buildings, which were now and forever more drenched in flames and an eternal twilight.Â 

That is a story for *this* time, even though none of it was literally true. To Twilight Sparkle it may as well have been.

First, that fiasco with her wings. Her lunch break hadn't been disturbed so thoroughly since last week - {ch-010-repl-1}

Second, nopony wanted her feedback on their misappropriation of the principles of taxation. And they {ch-010-repl-2} told her to shut up, too!

Third, but certainly not third in order of severity, her castle had {ch-010-repl-3} Who even *does* that? She wished she'd have been present for *that* vote, so she could give them a piece of her mind - but alas, they'd have probably told her to shut up then, too.

The mayor was gone, and the citizens had no respect for the next closest thing to an authority figure - their own Princess of Friendship. This town was going to Tartarus in a tote bag. Soon, Friendship itself would fall, cast aside in one democratic outcome or another, and all would fall to ruin. 

All would fall. And there was nopony to turn to.

Except...

Twilight recoiled from the idea as soon as it came to mind. She knew her ancient history. 'Liberty, Equality, Catastrophy', they used to say, of the Mareideians, those first practitioners of democracy in Equestria, who, in their hubris, thought themselves free to command their own destiny. And it seemed they might succeed, too - until news of their rebellion reached Princess Celestia.

Few now remember their name, their motto, or their fate, cursing these poor souls in Ponyville to repeat the same. 

Twilight hesitated to put pen to paper, and stepped away to look out her window. Her {ch-010-repl-4} gave her a perfect vantage to see a crowd of ponies playing around with some sort of siege weapon, possibly a catapult, though it certainly wasn't aimed at her. In the distance, a great banner had been raised above a voting booth, to fire and fanfare. It read: 'RENAME PONYVILLE TO TOWNY MCTOWNFACE'. The line of ponies waiting to cast votes stretched far away.

With a sigh, Twilight returned to her desk.

"Well - quill, paper, what do you think?" She touched one to the other. "Should I send a letter to Celestia?"

Twilight Sparkle closed her eyes and waited for an answer.
