She woke up confused. Her bed was warm and comfortable. Light was coming in from the window the same way it always did. Birds were chirping and there was hay and flowers and firewood in the air, like always. But still something felt *off* to Twilight. 

She wasn't running a fever, and she wasn't nauseous. Her throat didn't hurt when she swallowed. She wasn't dizzy when she got out of bed and stood up. Her room was organized exactly how she'd left it. What else could it be?
