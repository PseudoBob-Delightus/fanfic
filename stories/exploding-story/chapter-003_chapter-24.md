# Pinkie Pie

Twilight knocked on Pinkie's bedroom door and the door opens.

Twilight entered. "Pinkie, are you here?"

A rustle came from one of Pinkie's cabinets, before moments later Pinkie sprung out of it doing cartwheels.

Pinkie stopped just before hitting Twilight, her mane springing forward, booping Twilight.

"Hi, Twilight, what's up?"

"I was wonder if you knew anything about that?" Twilight points up at the title.

"Oh," Pinkie said in wonder, "I wonder what happens when a story explodes!"

"So, you didn't have anything to do with this?"

"No, do you think I could touch it if I jump high enough?"

"Pinkie, this is serious. We need to figure out what's going on."

Pinkie wasn't listening, she was already jumping to try and touch the title.

"Pinkie!"

After another moment of hopelessly trying to touch it, Pinkie gave up. She Noticed Twilight was still there and said, "Twilight? What are you doing here still?"

"We need to go and figure this out."

"Okay, let me grab my *exploding story confetti* and I'll be ready!" Pinkie says before rummaging in her closet.

"Why do you have confetti for exploding stories?"

Pinkie lifts out a confetti container, marked on the side in bubbly font: Exploding Story Confetti. "Never ask why Twilight, ask why not."

"Okay, so, you're ready?"

"Yes, an exploding story sounds fun! I can't wait to see what happens."

"Okay, let's go, Pinkie."

Pinkie nods then Twilight started out the door. Pinkie followed behind, bouncing bubbly with a smile.
