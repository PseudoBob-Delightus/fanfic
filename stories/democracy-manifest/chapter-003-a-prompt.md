A minor Rainbow Dash story and a minor Applejack story collide. They want passers-by to decide which of them is more attractive, but since it has to be in the form of a proposal, they have to decide which one gets to be the subject of the proposal (i.e. "I propose that Rainbow Dash is prettier than Applejack", or vice versa). This starts a recursive spiral that takes three or four chapters to resolve.
