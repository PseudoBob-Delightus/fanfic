"A catapult? Really?"

"That pink pony said she, like, didn't have a cannon big enough, or something."

"But she's a pegasus. She can just fly, can't she?"

"Come on, babe, it's Fluttershy. She doesn't fly."

"But she *can*." Poppyseed looked over at Fluttershy, who was sitting in the bucket of the catapult, which was, itself, situated in Ponyville town square. "You *can* fly, right?"

"Um... Yes?"

Sunflower rolled her eyes. "But you *won't*, right?"

"Um... Not if it would cause any problems for you..."

"Well it will," Poppyseed said. "So don't."

"Okay..."

"Gosh, you're annoying. Alright, ponies," Poppyseed addressed the assembled crowd. "It's time for business."

An eager stallion raised his hoof. "Are we finally going to see justice served?"

"Ugh, no," Poppyseed gagged. "We're gonna execute Fluttershy. Who's in?"
