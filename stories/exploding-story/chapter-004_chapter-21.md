Twilight, Spike, and Pinkie Pie arrived at the Apple farm, each more worried than the next. That is to say, Twilight was still a nervous wreck, Pinkie was still a ball of giggles, and Spike was somewhere in the vast between. 

Big Mac waved from the fields and chatted with Spike as the two ponies looked for Applejack. She wasn't far - just over a hill, tilling and seeding for annual crops, like carrots, celery, and various other things that weren't going to sprout before the story exploded.

"Applejack!" Twilight called.

"Yeah?" she answered. "Oh, hey Twilight! You here about that thing in the sky?"

"Yep," Twilight answered. She was relieved to find somepony who was being rational about this whole thing.

"So are you just gatherin' everypony together for an adventure, like you always do?"

"Yeah, I - wait, I do that?"

Applejack nodded. "Yeah, sugar cube. You do."

Twilight looked down at her hooves, thinking about what she'd just learned.

"Well, let's go, then," Applejack continued, dropping her seedbags under a tree and falling in place next to Pinkie Pie. 

"Right," Twilight agreed. "Right. Let's go."
