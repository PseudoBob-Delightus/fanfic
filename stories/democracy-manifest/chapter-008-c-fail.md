It had been harder than expected to get a bunch of ponies together to hunt down Fluttershy. The gullible young stallions had all gone out for coffee, it seemed, leaving only the dour, dark-faced stallions, and a few mares of similar quality. This type was none too impressed with Sunflower's airheaded charm, but they were Poppyseed's specialty, if she did say so herself. And she did. So they were. 

Before long they had a small army of repressed, angry ponies, slightly too old to pass as college students, and raring to form a disorderly mob. All they needed was a push in the right direction, and off they went.

The mob marched up and over the hills, through the grasslands, and over the stream, and they arrived at Fluttershy's house. They hammered on the door, then tired of waiting, broke it down, and dragged Fluttershy away, and then they all turned around and carried her back the way they came.

"Hay, Sunflower," Poppyseed asked, mid-mob.

"Like, yeah?" Sunflower replied.

"What do you think we should do with Fluttershy once we bring her back to town?"

"I dunno... Like, execute her, maybe? I thought this was all your idea?"

"Execute her!? Oh my gosh," Poppyseed gasped. "That's... such a great idea, you know?"

"I literally have my moments, babe."
