Pinkie Pie stands shocked as she see the fact that she won. "How am I cuter!?"

Fluttershy giggles and says softly, "I told you so!"

The ponies that voted for her shouted out a few reasons.

"Your smile is so infectious!"

"Your mane is so fluffy!"

"Your colors are so pretty!"

The group began to leave as Pinkie turned to Fluttershy.

Pinkie hugs Fluttershy. "I'm so surprised! I totally thought you would win!"

Fluttershy giggles and hugs back.

After the hug is over, Fluttershy looks back at the group that had decided and makes a decision. "Pinkie, I need to go for now, I'll see you later?"

Pinkie smiles, "Okay, bye Fluttershy!"

Fluttershy smiles back. "Bye, Pinkie the cute!"
