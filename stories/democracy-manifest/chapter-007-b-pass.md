"And *stay out*!"

The green-faced human flew out of the door to the hospital and landed on his butt with a commercially licensed 'oof'. After a moment of shock, he slowly picked himself up, rubbed at his wounds new and old, and shambled down the hill.

"I feel bad," Redheart said, looking through the front window. "He looks so dejected."

Doctor Horse grumbled, "That's because we dejected him. Having second thoughts?"

"I'm having third and fourth thoughts, Doctor H- oh my goodness!"

Doctor Horse was confused, but followed her shocked stare and pointed hoof out the window, and saw there a rickety cargo wagon coming loose from its draft and careening straight towards the human. Slow and delirious as he was, he failed to get out of the way in time. The wagon bowled into him and tumbled into a million pieces of wood and apple.

A moment passed where the scene of the crash looked lifeless. The wagon's draft, a crimson-red earth pony who Redheart recognized as a member of the Apple clan, ran over to assess the damage, but everything froze when the wreckage shifted and the human emerged. He looked in even worse condition than he'd been in before - his office clothes were in tatters and he was covered head-to-tail in applesauce and splinters - but all he did was shake his head, throw an arm down as if to say 'aw, shucks', and continue limping way.

Redheart looked at Doctor Horse, and Doctor Horse looked at Redheart, and they both fell over in an unrelenting burst of laughter.
