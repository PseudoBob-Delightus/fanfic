A discarded flag, or it might have been a plastic bag for all anypony cared, tumbled its way across the ash-charred streets of Ponyville and its incorporeal remains of buildings, which were now and forever more drenched in flames and an eternal twilight. 

But that's a story for another time.

Today, the sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and a crowd of ponies had gathered in interest around a peculiar argument: a pair of ponies trying to decide which sort of pie to have for their picnic.

"Apple."

"Pecan." (*PEE-can)*

"Apple."

"Pecan."

"Apple."

"Pecan."

"Wait, wait, wait… What did you say?"

"I said, Pecan, we should have pecan pie, you know."

"The other pony shook her head… I don't think that's right at all. No, no, not at all. Are you sure it's not pronounced Pecan (*pee-KAHN*)? I mean, maybe you pronounce it like that if it comes out of a can… but it sounds wrong even then."

"No, I'm pretty sure it's Pecan (*PEE-can)*."

"Pecan."

"Pecan."

"Pecan."

"Pecan."

"Pecan."

"Pecan."

"Pecan."

"Pecan!"

"Pecan!"

"Cake!" (*KAYK* -rhymes with "bake")

"Pecan!"

"Pecan!"

"Cake!"

"Pecon!"

"Cake!"

"Pecan."

"Cake!"

"Pecan."

"Cake!"

"Pecan? Wait? Wait, wait, wait! Who's saying cake?"

"Oh... My bad, saw you two arguing, thought it looked fun… and it has been! Thanks! I have to carry on now, but thank you for your time. Bye!!! Oh, and see ya later, readers!"

There was an estranged moment of silence before…

"Pecan!"

"Pecan!"

"Pecan!"

"Pecan!"

"Pecan!"

Perhaps finally growing tired of the argument, or perhaps just developing neck pain, a voice in the crowd shouted out:

"Let's have a vote!"

There was some muttering amongst the crowd, and a vote to vote was cast, and then a vote to determine whether or not the vote counted if the entire town wasn't present, and several more besides, until finally-

"Say yay for Pecan or neigh for the alternative pronunciation, which I personally refuse to say."
