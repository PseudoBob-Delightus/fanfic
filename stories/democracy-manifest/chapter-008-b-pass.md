It had been easier than expected to get a bunch of ponies together to hunt down Fluttershy. But, with Sunflower's disarming, airheaded charm, and Poppyseed's eye for gullibility, they had the pick of the lot from the young stallions about the market - and a few young mares with hearts in their eyes, too. The only thing they all needed was a push in the right direction, and off they went.

An orderly mob marched up and over the hills, through the grasslands, and over the stream, and they arrived at Fluttershy's house. They hammered on the door in a thundering, *orderly* fashion. And when Fluttershy opened the door, they grabbed her, and brought her back to town. Orderly.

"Hay, Sunflower," Poppyseed asked.

"Like, yeah?" Sunflower replied.

"What do you think we should do with Fluttershy once we bring her back to town?"

"I dunno... Like, execute her, maybe? I thought this was all your idea?"

"Execute her!? Oh my gosh," Poppyseed gasped. "That's... such a great idea, you know?"

"I literally have my moments, babe."
