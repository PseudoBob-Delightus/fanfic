As hooves shot up in agreement, the murmuring of approval with Scootaloo's words quickly grew into shouts and cries of a hard won victory. 

Hopping down from her pedestal, Scootaloo was quickly swarmed by her peers and lifted above them, thrown into the air in time with their loving cheers.

"We did it! We won! Scootaloo rules! Adults-"

Their cheering was halted immediately by the sound of the school bell rang out louder than they could ever be. Turning their eyes to the schoolhouse, they could see their teacher standing patiently in the doorway, staring at their little celebration.

"Alright children, wrap it up!" Cheerilee said sweetly, a gentle smile across her lips. "Recess is over, and now it's time to learn about the wonderful world of *long division*!" 

Although she was no longer being thrown upwards, Scootaloo still maintained her position above the ponies who had lifted her. Standing atop them all, she puffed out her chest with all the bravado a winning politician could muster. 

Which is to say: quite a lot.

"Hey, you can't tell us what to do!" Scootaloo bravely squawked, a beaming grin lighting her face. "We all voted that adults can't control us anymore!"

Pressing a hoof to her heart, Cheerilee looked at the supposed voters with a look of adoration, not unlike one you'd give when looking at a group of silly little foals. 

Which, of course, she was.

"Oh, my little ponies, you all aren't allowed to vote!" Cheerilee smiled softly, her voice a mixture of sweetness as well as just a spoonful of pity. "You're *far* too young to understand the intricacies of governmental structures, as well as the overarching consequences that could come from any single petition. Any vote you all engaged in is, I'm sorry to say, completely null and void!"

The ground gave way under Scootaloo's hooves. 

Quite literally, as the ponies supporting her began to slowly shuffle back towards the classroom, heads low and vibes completely destroyed as their sure victory had been snatched from them and replaced with cold, hard defeat.

Slowly picking herself up from the ground, Scootaloo found herself yet again surrounded by her only two remaining supporters: Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom.

"Well, that sucked." Scootaloo sighed, shaking her head as she dusted herself off. "I really figured that'd work!" 

"Almost did. But I guess adults always gotta get the final say somehow." Apple Bloom grumbled, her eyes narrowing as she stared over at a still smiling Cheerilee.

Sweetie Belle dejectedly flopped herself back over the bars of the carousel where they had all begun. "Now we're *never* gonna get to that concert!" 

"Well… you could always still sneak out." Scootaloo said with a small shrug.

"You girls wanna vote on it?"
