Pinkie just shrugs as the vote fails and bounces off to ask Fluttershy out anyway. "Eh, guess you can't win 'em all."

The mare running the vote just scratches her head. "...Why did she even call a vote if she was gonna ask Fluttershy out anyway?"

When Pinkie arrives, she gives Fluttershy a hug. "Hi, Fluttershy!"

Fluttershy returns the hug. "Hi, Pinkie."

Pinkie nuzzles Fluttershy.

Fluttershy blushes and whispers, "I love you…"

Pinkie whispers back, "I love you, too."

After the hug, Fluttershy looks at the ground, her eyes focused on Pinkie's hoof.

Pinkie notices and offers it to her.

Fluttershy accepts her offer and blushes.

Pinkie says, "Fluttershy… I really like you."

Fluttershy blushes. "I really like you too."

Fluttershy notices that Pinkie seems uncomfortable and asks, "Is everything okay, Pinkie?"

Pinkie responds, hesitantly, "Well, I just… kinda, sorta, maybe have a teensy little crush on you… I asked the ponies earlier and they said I shouldn't ask you out, but I decided I want to anyway… would you want to go out with me? It's okay if you don't?"

Fluttershy responds excitedly, "Oh, absolutely! I wanted to ask you out too, but I was too scared…"

Fluttershy smiles as Pinkie hugs her again. Pinkie responds, "Yay!"

"Yay indeed!"

The hug ends and Fluttershy says, "…I still think you're cuter."

Pinkie replies, "I might be biased, but you're cuter."

Fluttershy blushes and hugs Pinkie to hide it. "I love you."

Pinkie hugs back. "I love you too!"
