"Looks like the aye's have it," was the final declaration after enough ponies yelled out in support that no one had felt confident offering a dissenting opinion afterward. "Let's get to it then."

The task of moving an entire castle should have been the biggest engineering project of the decade. It should have been a task that required whole teams of engineers and architects and project managers and surveyors and laborers and catering teams and overpaid middle managers. The permits and planning alone should have taken months to arrange.

And it would have... except this was Ponyville. A small town that didn't give a bunny's fuzzy behind over those kind of complicated things. When they wanted something done (and got around to actually deciding on it) they just went ahead and did it. It's best not to think about how (and trying has sent many Canterlot academics to bed with migraines) beyond a healthy dose of gumption, elbow grease, and can-do attitude.

But however it got done, at the end of the day (or, more realistically, about twenty minutes later) the grand crystal edifice that had once lingered on the edge of town like a wallflower at a party now stood proudly at the very center of Ponyville central plaza in all its shining glory.

"I'll admit," somepony in the crowd said as they wiped the sweat off their brow, "it does look awful pretty up close like this."

"Like a giant gemstone," another said, squinting against the glare.

"Does anypony else feel like it's getting hotter?" a third asked as she fanned herself.

As a few more ponies voiced their agreement, the clouds overhead began to shift, allowing the sun to peek through the gaps and send forth a few questing beams of light towards the relocated castle. The crystalline branches seemed to practically glow as the light passed through them, only to refract in a slightly different direction and pass through another branch. Then another. And another.

In moments of slowly dawning realization, time often feels as if it were moving like molasses. Thus, every pony in the crowd was able to watch as the sunbeams moved from one crystal facet to the next, bouncing and bending and combining together into a visibly brighter focus.

"Uh oh," said the town optometrist, the one Ponyvillian who knew more than the average yokel about lenses and optical mechanics.

From the branch supporting the castle's south wing library, the concentrated beam of undiluted sunlight took a hard right turn, bounced off the center trunk, and finally left the confines of the castle on an unerring path straight towards the gathered crowd.

"Hit the deck!"

About half the ponies followed the command. The rest, having never been on a boat in their lives, still scattered anyway out of good old-fashioned panic. The beam sliced through where they'd been standing, drawing a scorched line through the earth. The castle groaned slightly as the heat began to warp some of the crystals, twisting their angles and splitting the artificial recreation of Celestia's Fury into a disco ball of death that sent searing solar lasers in sweeping passes across the town.

As fires erupted in its wake and ponies ran screaming, one stallion stood still in quiet consideration. His eyes tracked the path of the beam, judged the pattern of the angles, then made a few approximations based on the castle's former location.

"Aha!" He smacked one hoof against the other as all the pieces finally clicked into place. "So *that's* why my pool was always way too hot to swim in!"

Another plume of fire rose from an unfortunate house caught in the solar beam's path.

"My zinnias! No!"

Of course, even in the chaos of a pony-made horror within their comprehension, there were a few level-headed sorts who tried to get things under control.

"Pull the clouds back!" A pegasus called out. "We hafta block the sun!"

"No!" An earth pony countered. "We need to put it back where it was!"

"Maybe we should hold a vote on it?"

"Not the time!"
