After that mix-up with her wings, Twilight was in a mind to take a walk.

It was still a beautiful day in Ponyville. The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, all that boring stuff. One thing that put a bit of a damper on things was a trail of littered pamphlets strewn around the streets on this side of town, but if there was one thing that didn't bother Twilight much... well, it wouldn't have been picking up litter. But if there was one thing that didn't bother Twilight much *and* it began with 'picking up' and ended with 'litter', it would be. You know. That.

So she picked up every discarded pamphlet with her magic. She floated them up into the air, de-crumpled and flattened them, made neat little stacks; the works. While she was at it, she might as well do a little light reading, she thought.

Twilight read the words 'NO REPRESENTATION WITHOUT TAXATION' in big letters on the very first pamphlet, thought about it a little, and made a noise that sounded like, "hm." As she kept reading, she kept saying, "hm," though in a progressively more concerned tone. She continued to follow and pick up after the trail until she reached what looked like the aftermath of one of Pinkie's party cannons, and two vaguely familiar earth ponies.

Sea Swirl, the mare, seemed {ecstatic and more than a little drunk} {OR} {like she'd been crying recently, or drinking recently, or both}. Hughbert Jellius, the stallion, seemed a little disappointed. With what, exactly, was unclear.

"Excuse me," Twilight said in an ask-y voice, "is this yours?" She held up one of the pamphlets.

Hughbert Jellius nodded, and was about to say something when Sea Swirl piped up, "Sure is! Our gosh-darn pride-and-joy, that is!" {She seemed quite happy about it.} {OR} {She seemed quite bitter about it.} Hughbert subsequently kept his mouth shut.

"Good. Well, if you don't mind, I have some... rather critical feedback. The whole premise of this, er, 'campaign' is seriously flawed. The concepts of taxation, representation, and democracy really have nothing to do with each other, logically speaking. Furthermore, while there are representative units in the diarchal government, and the constitutional foundation of these units specifies that they must be taxed, the units are established *solely* by the Crown. Levying a tax on yourselves will not compel anypony to-"

"Oh my Celestia, *shut up*!" Hughbert shouted.

"-awp." Twilight was not used to being spoken to like that. She was so taken aback that her mouth shut on its own accord, forming its own strange, unnatural phoneme.

Hughbert continued, "{It already happened, alright?} {OR} {It didn't even happen, alright?} So can you just shut up and leave us alone?"

Sea Breeze echoed him with, "Yeah, it's our moment of glory, so shut it!" Though Twilight had a hard time reading the tone of that one.

She just shook her head. "Look, I don't like to play this card, but you know you're talking to a *princess*, right? All I'm saying is-"

Sea Breeze blew a raspberry at her. "Hey, Hujert, why don't we democracy her?"

"Good idea. *Princess* Twilight, I propose you shut up."
