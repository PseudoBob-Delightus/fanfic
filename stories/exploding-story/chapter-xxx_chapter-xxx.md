# Rainbow x Rarity

I am about to knock on Rarity's door when it opens.

"Oh, Rainbow Dash, just the pony I was coming to find. Would you like to come in?"

"Sure, I had something I needed to talk about."

"I also had something I wanted to talk about."

Rarity leads them over to her couch, where they sit down.

"I'll let you go first," I say, delaying my confession.

Rarity takes a moment to say anything. Eventually she says in a gentle tone, "Rainbow Dash, I love you." Her face turns to that of worry, like she truly doesn't realize I am here doing the same as her.

I don't let her worry for long, saying, "Rarity, I love you too!" My eyes start to water.

We both lean forward, grabbing each other in a tight hug. We hold it for a while before letting go. I nuzzle her cheek before backing away fully.

Noticing the blush present on her face, I can't help but think, she is the most beautiful mare ever.

I decide to inform her of this fact. "You know, normally I consider myself as number one at everything, but there is one thing I don't mind you being number one at."

"What?"

"You are the most beautiful mare ever."

As I finish the compliment, I realize there is a massive blush on my face.

Rarity looks me in the eyes, not breaking contact, she slowly leans in.

I instinctively lean in, anticipating our first kiss.

As our lips meet, I wrap my hooves around her, holding her gently.

We release weeks of pent up passion into the kiss, both of our eyes watering.

As we break the kiss, Rarity apologizes, "I'm sorry it took me so long to say anything."

"Me too."

"I just couldn't tell how you felt about meâ€¦ then that happened," Rarity points up at the title.

It ticks down another minute as we look at it; I reflexively hold her tighter.

Rarity nuzzles her head to my chest. "If this is our last day together, I'm at least glad I am about to spend it with you."

I nuzzle the top of her head. "Me too." I kiss her head.

We sit there in silence for a while, just enjoying each others presence.

I whisper in her ear, "I love you."

She whispers back, "I love you too," before kissing my chest.

"Do you think Twilight will be able to figure out how to stop it?"

"I sure hope so."

"Me too, Rarity."
