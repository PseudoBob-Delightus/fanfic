She woke up confused. Her bed was warm and comfortable. Light was coming in from the window the same way it always did. Birds were chirping and there was hay and flowers and firewood in the air, like always. But still something felt *off* to Twilight. 

She wasn't running a fever, and she wasn't nauseous. Her throat didn't hurt when she swallowed. She wasn't dizzy when she got out of bed and stood up. Her room was organized exactly how she'd left it. What else could it be?

Maybe it was the cloying memory of a fading dream. Or maybe it was nothing at all. Twilight shrugged and decided it was probably nothing, or probably the dream thing, which was pretty close to nothing anyway.

So she went about her normal pony business, like brushing her mane. It felt good to brush her mane for the last time. After that, she headed downstairs to get breakfast ready-

Wait.

*For the last time?*

Why did she think that?

What did that mean?

Spike yawned and plodded past her. "Hey Twilight," he groaned. "You gonna use the shower?"

"Oh," Twilight said. "No, I was, I was going downstairs. Go ahead."

"Alrighty," Spike said, clearly a little confused over how Twilight was acting.
