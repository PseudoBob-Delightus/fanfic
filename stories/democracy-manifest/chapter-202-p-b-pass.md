Pinkie smiles. "that was fun!"

The group of ponies wish her luck as she rushes back to where she left Fluttershy.

"Fluttershy!"

"Pinkie?"

"Fluttershy!"

"Pinkie?"

Pinkie hugs Fluttershy, ending the cycle before it got out of hoof.

Fluttershy hugs back and says, "I love you…"

"I love you, too!"

Fluttershy hugs tighter.

Pinkie nuzzles Fluttershy before the hug ends.

Pinkie blushes. "Hey, Fluttershy… I had something I wanted to ask if you don't mind"

Fluttershy replies curiously, "What's going on, Pinkie?"

Pinkie blushes. "Well, I really really like you… and I wanted to ask you something. It's okay if you say no."

Fluttershy giggles. "I really like you too! And I can answer your question."

"Fluttershy, do you want to go out with me?"

Fluttershy blushes. "Yes! I'd love to."

Pinkie cheers. "Yay!"

Fluttershy takes a page from her new marefriend and tackles her with a hug.

Pinkie counters with a hug of her own, holding Fluttershy tight.

They sit up and giggle while still holding each other. Pinkie boops Fluttershy on the nose.

Fluttershy whispers, "I wanted to ask you out too, I might have if you didn't ask me first."

Pinkie replies, "How could I not ask you out, you're the cutest pony in the world!"

Fluttershy giggles. "I still think you are cuter."

Pinkie giggles. "I love you!"

Fluttershy replies, "I love you too!"
