"The 'aye's, like, have it," Sunflower said. "More or less."

Poppyseed cried, "That's good enough for me!" and kicked the pin out from the locking hook.

Nothing happened right away - it appeared stuck, and the siege engine creaked and groaned at the shift of force. Fluttershy emitted a noise that sounded like 'meep' as the tension in the arm built, curving it, knocking the whole thing into a strange shape. And then it released - but the arm did not stop at the frame abutment. It carried right through instead, causing an enormous 'bang' and a burst of wooden shrapnel, shredded rope, and pulverized cobblestone.

Many of the assembled voters dove for cover. By the time the dust settled and the first curious onlookers returned to the scene, they were shocked to find a hole, just where the catapult's bucket had come to rest, of impressive depth and conspicuous shape. It was shaped like the outline of a pegasus.

Rather than sending its payload far into the distance, the catapult had launched Fluttershy directly into the ground.

For a moment, there was a feeling of elation. *We've done it*, they all thought; *we've killed Fluttershy!*

This feeling lasted only until a wisp of pink and yellow smoke emerged from the hole, formed itself into the ghostly shape of Fluttershy, and asked in echoes and whispers: "Did I do good?"

"Oh, *great*," Poppyseed groaned. "She's a ghost now."

"Those are, like, way harder to get rid of than regular ponies, you know," Sunflower commented.

"Sorry," Flutterghost said.

"I'll bet." Poppyseed shook her head, and trotted away from the scene. "Welp, we did our best, folks. You guys are on your own."

"Hay! This was all your idea!" shouted a stallion from earlier. "We want our money back!"

"We didn't, like, take money? Literally what are you talking about."

The stallion's indignant rage at the continued existence of Fluttershy only became more severe. "Well then... you're next!" 

Sunflower and Poppyseed snorted and giggled as they ran away from the bloodthirsty crowd, perhaps not taking this all as seriously as they should have. That left only Fluttershy, floating mid-air above the broken catapult and the big hole, wondering what she was going to do now that she was dead and also a ghost.
