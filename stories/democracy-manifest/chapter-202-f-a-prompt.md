Fluttershy trots over to the ponies that decided Pinkie was cuter and tries to get their attention.

"Umm… Hello?"

The crowd doesn't respond…

Fluttershy clears her throat and speaks up, "Umm, excuse me everypony, I need your help– if you don't mind."

They recognize her and a different pony than before steps forward, "Hello, miss."

Fluttershy tries to explain what she needs. "I um… wanted some help… deciding something else…"

The pony replies, "Oh, what is that? We're always up to vote on anything!"

The other ponies nod in agreement, their attention now fixed on Fluttershy.

"Well, um, you see… I kinda have a… crush… on her."

"I see."

"…And I wanted to know if maybe I should try to ask her out."

"I get where this is going."

Fluttershy smiles, appearing more relaxed after getting that off her chest. "She's just so amazing, I really want to ask her out, but I don't know if I could do it without the support of a bunch of ponies I don't know who agree that she is cuter than me."

"That's very kind of you. We appreciate that you value our opinions so much. We won't let you down."

The pony gave a look to all the ponies voting that said, *you know what to do.*

"Okay ponies, time to vote on this filly's feelings! Hooves up if you think Fluttershy should ask out Pinkie!"
