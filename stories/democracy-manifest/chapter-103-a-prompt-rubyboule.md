The collective crowd of ponies felt as though they were really starting to find their groove with this whole "democracy" thing. With several votes under their collective belts and several ponies (debatably) helped by their decisions, the whole unnatural process of "choosing for themselves" was starting to feel a little more comfortable.

Comfortable enough for one nervous face in the crowd to raise his voice above the others.

"I know what we should vote on next!" he shouted, his voice only slightly pinching into a squeak at the end as the eyes of the crowd turned on him.

The stallion in question—one Davenport, proprietor of the local Quills and Sofas Emporium—took a second to regain his composure before pitching his spiel. "I'd like to propose relocating Twilight's castle to the center of town." A small wave of confused murmurs spread through the crowd, their hesitancy buoying him on. "I mean, I think it makes sense. Such an important cultural touchstone shouldn't be stuck way outside of town, right? It's just bad civic planning."

"Hey!" said Level Line, from the civic planning office. "We didn't have anything to do with that mess! But I do agree. Its current location means visitors have to take a very roundabout route from the train station to get there, and some side streets are getting a lot more hoof traffic than they were designed for."

"Is it that much of a problem?" someone asked.

Level Line shrugged. "Not really. Worst case we might have to start replacing the cobbles a few years earlier than projected, but it's something to consider."

"Alright," a pegasus mare called out, flying up just high enough to gather attention. "Motion to relocate Twilight's castle to the center of town. Thoughts from the floor?"

"Yeah, I gots one." Rotating a piece of wheat stalk to the opposite corner of his mouth, a stallion in a set of dirty overalls spoke up. "Where 'zactly you mean by 'the middle a'town'? Cause that's gonna be mighty diff'ent dependin' which farms you count as being part of Ponyville."

"An' *who* exactly are you thinkin' don't count?" asked a nearly identical farmer chewing on a barley stalk instead.

While other members continued to argue the semantics of the plan, a rather short unicorn gave Davenport a sharp poke to the ribs.

"Ow! What?"

"Fess up."

"What?"

"What's your real reason for moving the castle?"

Davenport huffed and looked elsewhere. "Can't a stallion be concerned over the state of his city?"

"Davey, I've known you since we were foals. I'd bet every bit in the bank that that's the first time you've ever said 'cultural touchstone' or 'civic planning' in your life. Now dish."

"I have no idea what you mean," he lied. "My motives are purely altruistic."

"Look, I won't tell anyone else."

"...Pinkie Promise?"

His friend rolled his eyes. "*Wow*. Great to see how much trust twenty years of friendship gets me. Yeah, sure, Pinkie Promise," he agreed, making the required motions of the sacred pact.

"...it blocks my view."

"It *blocks* your *view?*"

"Of Merry May's house."

"Of... Celestia's sake, just ask her out already!"

"I will!... eventually. Until then it's nice to watch her work in her garden. She's got some lovely zinnias this season."

Meanwhile, outside the scope of one stallion's voyeuristic affections, the crowd had managed to work out most of the kinks of the proposal.

"So that's the center of town as defined by the location of Ponyville Plaza," recited a mare who'd been keeping track of the discussion, "rotated eastward by a quarter turn so tourists'll have to walk past more shops to get to the door. Anything else or are we ready to vote?"

"One thing:" a young voice piped up from the crowd. "Has anyone thought about asking what Twilight thinks about this? It's her house, after all."

"C'moooon," a petite mare drawled from the other side of the crowd. "It's *Twilight*. She'd mow your lawn and do your taxes for you if you ask nicely."

"Filly, the *only* reason she did your taxes was because she took one look at that abomination to logic you call math and nearly had a heart attack."

"So? She still did them."

"Alright!" A crackle of lightning captured the crowd's incredibly short attention span as a pegasus kicked a cloud. "I think I've heard enough. Time to put your bits where your mouth is and vote. On the motion of moving Twilight's castle to the center of town, yea or nay?"
