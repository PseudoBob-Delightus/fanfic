"Work, work!" Rover barked at his inferiors. "Ponies only resting for short time! Work!"

The rest of the diamond dogs growled in frustration. They *were* already working! But they knew to listen to their leader, so they worked a little harder. Besides, tunnels wouldn't dig themselves.

Rover moved on to a chamber of artisans. These dogs were not digging, but hammering, bending, and cutting metal into armor and weapons.

Rover found a well-made spear and pointed to the leather lashings around its handle. He made a show of ripping the lashing off and throwing it away before handing it back to an artisan. "Work faster, not better." The dogs nodded and resumed work on only the most essential features.

Satisfied, Rover made his way back to the war room. Spot and Fido were there, arguing over the finer details of a dirt-scrawled map on the floor.

The whole den had been at work for two nights straight - ever since that title had shown up and started counting down the minutes.

Still, only four hours left... Not a lot of time. A dog might get worried.

But not Rover.

He was *definitely* not worried that everything might suddenly end in a fiery explosion a pawful of hours from now. Only silly ponies would fall for this nonsense. 

It... *was* nonsense...

...

Right?
