A small herd of ponies gathered around a fence in ponyville.Â 

There was a bucket of white paint next to this fence.

The owner of this fence looked around in appreciation, cleared his throat, and announced, "I propose that this here fence be painted with this here paint."

The ponies looked at the fence, then at the bucket of paint, then at the stallion who owned the fence. The clamour of silence was broken by a pegasus raising her hoof to cast not a vote, but a question: "Why?"

Everypony looked at her. Especially the owner of the fence.

"Wha-! What do you mean why?" he sputtered. "It's a fence! It needs t' be painted! And I gots the paint right here from my house, so I figured, why not use the rest of it."

The pegasus was uncowed. "If it were so simple as that, we wouldn't need to vote on it, would we?" A few others in the crowd nodded, and murmurs of 'that's a good point' and such rose to a din. She continued, "I think we, as potential voters, ought to have a good reason to vote for your fence-painting proposal." This was met with resounding approval from the crowd.

"It really ain't that big a deal, folks," the fence-owner grumbled. "I only wanted a second opinion."

Another member of the crowd spoke up. "If you want our support, convince us! Make an argument!"

The fence-owner scratched his neck and sighed. "Hah... Well, alright. But I ain't no good at this argumentation thing, so you'll have to cut me some slack. Ahem.

"Ponies of this here... uh... fair township. I'm thinkin' y'all don't like to put things to waste. Am I right?" A few nods. "Right. Well, it so happens that I already done used half this paint paintin' my house. Naturally that means I got half the bucket left over. Seein' as how you and I don't want puttin' it to waste, I oughta paint somethin' else with it, right?" More nods.

"Eh, point of order," the pegasus piped up. "I don't think you ought to do anything with it, by that logic... technically speaking..."

The fence-owner, and half the members of the crowd, looked at her in a manner that ponies didn't like to be looked at in.

She continued, "But seeing as how we've agreed that we'd all like to do something with it, I can forgive the... uh... carry on, please."

"... If'n I ought to do somethin' with it," the fence-owner said, "I look around for things that need paintin', and the first thing that comes to mind is this here fence what's been peelin' a bit since last winter. Why not, I ask you? It's my paint, and it's my fence, and it's great paintin' weather. If I were you, and one o' you were me, er, one o' you were askin' me the same thing, I'd say 'aye', or whatever, and know it was a good thing as good as done."

His speech concluded, the crowd of potential voters braced themselves for a monumental decision.
