As the votes were counted, Hughbert Jellius felt relief from the pit that had been forming in his stomach. It seemed the 'aye's did *not* have it, and so there would be no great tax collection via Filthy Rich.

Sea Breeze begged the voters for another chance. "Please," she cried, "give it another chance! It won't work if we don't have a tax!"

Hughbert sat by her side as she began to sob. He wasn't sure how or even *when* she'd become so enamored with this idea, but it must have occurred during one of the power-meetings she'd had with Filthy Rich (and company) on the lead-up to the vote. 

"Without a tax, it won't be *real*..."

He patted her shoulder. "It's better this way," he assured her. "That kind of money just causes problems."

Sea Breeze could only mutter, "I sure hope you're right."
