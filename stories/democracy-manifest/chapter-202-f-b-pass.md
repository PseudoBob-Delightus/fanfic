Fluttershy smiles as she gains the confidence to ask out her crush.

"Thank you all," she says to them.

The group of ponies wish her farewell.

Fluttershy gallops back to where she and Pinkie were earlier. Pinkie is still there.

"Pinkie?" Fluttershy asks.

"Hi, Fluttershy!" Pinkie says.

Fluttershy tries to take Pinkie's hoof and hold it, but Pinkie hugs her before she can.

"I love you, Fluttershy!"

Fluttershy blushes. "…I love you too, Pinkie. What's up?"

After the hug, Pinkie stares at Fluttershy with a warm smile. "I really like you."

"I really like you too. Actually, that's why I came back. I had something I wanted to ask you…"

"Oh, what is it? I love questions!"

Fluttershy blushes. "Pinkie, will you… go out with me?"

Pinkie's face lights up more than it already was. "Yes!"

Fluttershy pulls Pinkie into another hug as both mares smile and blush.

"You know what's crazy? I was about to ask you out too, but you beat me to it!" Pinkie snortles.

Fluttershy giggles too. "I asked you out because those ponies voted for it, and it gave me the confidence to do it."

Pinkie says, "Aww, that was so nice of them! I do still think you are cuter, though."

Fluttershy giggles and squeezes Pinkie in the hug. "I love you."

Pinkie nuzzles Fluttershy. "I love you, too!"
