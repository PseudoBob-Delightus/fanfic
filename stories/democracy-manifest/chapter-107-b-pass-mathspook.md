The crowd cheered. Ponies began to chant, "No more late fees! No more late fees!" as they marched victorious through the streets.

Twilight Sparkle was still recuperating from her collapse. The doctor had given her gentle head pats and said, "There, there. It'll be alright." He had assured her that she would feel better just as soon as she recognized ponies' right of self-governance.

She heard the crowd chanting from her hospital bed and began to cry. "Equestria!" she moaned. "Oh, Equestria!"

A nurse came by pushing a book cart. "Want a book?" asked the nurse. "Makes the time go by much quicker."

"Of course! That's just what I need right nowâ€”" Twilight froze in terror. "These are library books." She opened one. "Overdue library books. Years overdue."

"Oh, we just never bother to return them," said the nurse. "The late fees are too high. After a while, it's cheaper to pretend you lost the book."

"Really? Well, we ought to do something about that." The sound of chanting ponies came to her again. "Actually, maybe we just did. Maybe I feel a lot better now. Time to get going."
