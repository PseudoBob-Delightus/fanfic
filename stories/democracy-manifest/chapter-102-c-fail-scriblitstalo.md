"The votes are in! From henceforth, pecan shall be pronounced Pecan (PEE-kæn or PEE-can)!"

*"What!? No!? That can't be!"*

"What do you mean, a vote's a vote, it's Pecan."

"Say it like that one more time. I bucking dare you!"

Quite suddenly, a fight broke out amongst the crowd, several snouts were broken, and several laws were passed.

A discarded flag, or it might have been a plastic bag for all anypony cared, tumbled its way across the ash-charred streets of Ponyville and its incorporeal remains of buildings, which were now and forever more drenched in flames and an eternal twilight. 

But that's a story for another time.
