A long list of ponies, which shall not be recounted here, had come together to grab the rope and attempt to free Shadow from the confines of the well.

This was the moment of truth. 

"This is the moment of truth," Fine Fettle said, despite the groans and demands that he get on with it. "Are you ready?"

"Just..." Shadow hesitated. "... tell my family I love them?"

Another series of groans erupted, but Fine Fettle paid it no mind. "Of course. Um. Where can I find them?"

"At the cattle field across town."

"Oh. Right."

"Yeah."

"Well. Let's do it." Fine Fettle took a deep breath. He bit the rope, and his voice boomed: "*Pull!*"

All the ponies pulled. With a pair of groans - one from Shadow, the other from the wood and brick structure that encased him - and then a loud crack - from only the well, thankfully - the rope snapped away and all the ponies fell over. When they stood up and observed what had happened they found, to their satisfaction, Shadow was no longer stuck in the well.

The well hardly existed anymore either, alas, but the plan had worked.

"Ya-hoooo!" the bull shouted as he pranced about the wreckage, his hooves once again on solid ground. "Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh, I could kiss you!"

"Let's not get ahead of ourselves," Fine Fettle laughed. "To be honest, this was way less complicated than I thought it would be. I don't know what I was worrying about."

Sea Swirl muttered to herself, "This proves that, if us ponies work together, we can accomplish *anything*..."

Hughbert Jellius sat on the ground and whined over a hurting hoof. "I think I pulled something."

"Aw, it doesn't look so bad," Fine Fettle said, helping Hughbert back onto all fours. "And you know what they say: all's well that ends well."

"Shut up," everycreature said at the same time.
