"And the nay's have it," the pony designated to judge which group had sounded louder announced. "Looks like the castle stays where it is."

"Fan*tastic* ," Davenport groused, but not too loudly. Even if he'd been the one to bring it up, now that the group had decided, he didn't want to be singled out as having a dissenting opinion. "What's the point of this whole voting thing if I don't get what I want in the end?"

"Cheer up," his friend said, bumping his shoulder. "You're no worse off than you were before, so it's no big loss, right?"

"Yeah... I guess. But I still want to see Merry May."

"You know, instead of moving a whole castle for a better view, you could just rent a different house somewhere else."

"I dunno... that sounds like a lot of effort."

"Or literally just *talk* to her."

"Now you're just talking crazy."

"Seems reasonable enough to me." He grinned. "Why don't we put it to a vote? 'Should Davey ask out Merry?' I'm sure the debate portion would beâ€¦ *enlightening*."

"Oh don't you *dare*."
