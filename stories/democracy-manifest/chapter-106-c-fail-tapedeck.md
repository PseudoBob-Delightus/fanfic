A few hooves were raised in support of the sandwich by those present, Carrot Top being among them, but most ponies in attendance declined to do so. That was because even though the LHCT was the "hot new item" at the Ponyville Caf√©, not very many customers to the restaurant had actually tried it yet.

After expressing her gratitude to those who had indulged in helping her decision-making process, Lyra resumed her previous position at the table. "I guess I just voted for the salad because I already *knew* I would like it, and the results of the vote have proven that a number of other ponies might be taking the safe route as well."

"I wish you would have been able to try that sandwich today," the earth pony confided, "but as they say, there's always next time."

"Yeah, I would definitely be interested in ordering one of those sandwiches someday. If it's anything like the creamy goodness of the Caesar salad they serve here, I'll be one happy pony," smiled the unicorn.

As Carrot Top noticed the waiter approaching from a distance, she said, "By the way, I didn't know you were a thief, Lyra."

"Thief? What in Equestria do you mean by that?"

"Well...what you'll be ordering for lunch today is called a *Caesar* salad. Who's the poor mare you're seizing a salad from?" 

Lyra facehoofed.
